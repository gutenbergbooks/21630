<div class="clearfix"><div class="figleft"><img src="./images/ill-3.jpg" alt="I" title="I" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">n</span> every century for more than two
thousand years, many men have
owed their chief enjoyment of life
to books. The bibliomaniac of
today had his prototype in ancient
Rome, where book collecting was
fashionable as early as the first century of the
Christian era. Four centuries earlier there was an
active trade in books at Athens, then the center of
the book production of the world. This center
of literary activity shifted to Alexandria during
the third century <span class="smcap">b. c.</span> through the patronage of
Ptolemy Soter, the founder of the Alexandrian
Museum, and of his son, Ptolemy Philadelphus;
and later to Rome, where it remained for many<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii"></a>[<a href="./images/viii.png">viii</a>]</span>
centuries, and where bibliophiles and bibliomaniacs
were gradually evolved, and from whence in time
other countries were invaded.</p>

<p>For the purposes of the present work the middle
ages cover the period beginning with the seventh
century and ending with the time of the invention
of printing, or about seven hundred years, though
they are more accurately bounded by the years 500
and 1500 <span class="smcap">a. d.</span> It matters little, however, since
there is no attempt at chronological arrangement.</p>

<p>About the middle of the present century there
began to be a disposition to grant to medi&aelig;val
times their proper place in the history of the preservation
and dissemination of books, and Merryweather's
<i>Bibliomania in the Middle Ages</i> was one
of the earliest works in English devoted to the
subject. Previous to that time, those ten centuries
lying between the fall of the Roman Empire and
the revival of learning were generally referred to
as the Dark Ages, and historians and other writers
were wont to treat them as having been without
learning or scholarship of any kind.</p>

<p>Even Mr. Hallam,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> with all that judicial temperament
and patient research to which we owe so
much, could find no good to say of the Church or
its institutions, characterizing the early university<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix"></a>[<a href="./images/ix.png">ix</a>]</span>
as the abode of "indigent vagabonds withdrawn
from usual labor," and all monks as positive enemies
of learning.</p>

<p>The gloomy survey of Mr. Hallam, clouded no
doubt by his antipathy to all things ecclesiastical,
served, however, to arouse the interest of the period,
which led to other studies with different results,
and later writers were able to discern below the
surface of religious fanaticism and superstition so
characteristic of those centuries, much of interest
in the history of literature; to show that every age
produced learned and inquisitive men by whom
books were highly prized and industriously collected
for their own sakes; in short, to rescue the
period from the stigma of absolute illiteracy.</p>

<p>If the reader cares to pursue the subject further,
after going through the fervid defense of the love
of books in the middle ages, of which this is the
introduction, he will find outside of its chapters
abundant evidence that the production and care of
books was a matter of great concern. In the
pages of <i>Mores Catholici; or Ages of Faith</i>, by
Mr. Kenelm Digby,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> or of <i>The Dark Ages</i>, by Dr.
S. R. Maitland,<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> or of that great work of recent<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x"></a>[<a href="./images/x.png">x</a>]</span>
years, <i>Books and their Makers during the Middle
Ages</i>, by Mr. George Haven Putnam,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> he will see
vivid and interesting portraits of a great multitude
of medi&aelig;val worthies who were almost lifelong
lovers of learning and books, and zealous laborers
in preserving, increasing and transmitting them.
And though little of the mass that has come down
to us was worthy of preservation on its own account
as literature, it is exceedingly interesting as a
record of centuries of industry in the face of such
difficulties that to workers of a later period might
have seemed insurmountable.</p>

<p>A further fact worthy of mention is that book
production was from the art point of view fully
abreast of the other arts during the period, as must
be apparent to any one who examines the collections
in some of the libraries of Europe. Much of
this beauty was wrought for the love of the art
itself. In the earlier centuries religious institutions
absorbed nearly all the social intellectual movements
as well as the possession of material riches
and land. Kings and princes were occupied with
distant wars which impoverished them and deprived
literature and art of that patronage accorded to it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xi" id="Page_xi"></a>[<a href="./images/xi.png">xi</a>]</span>
in later times. There is occasional mention, however,
of wealthy laymen, whose religious zeal induced
them to give large sums of money for the
copying and ornamentation of books; and there
were in the abbeys and convents lay brothers whose
fervent spirits, burning with poetical imagination,
sought in these monastic retreats and the labor of
writing, redemption from their past sins. These
men of faith were happy to consecrate their whole
existence to the ornamentation of a single sacred
book, dedicated to the community, which gave
them in exchange the necessaries of life.</p></div>

<p>The labor of transcribing was held, in the
monasteries, to be a full equivalent of manual
labor in the field. The rule of St. Ferreol, written
in the sixth century, says that, "He who does not
turn up the earth with the plough ought to write
the parchment with his fingers."</p>

<p>Mention has been made of the difficulties under
which books were produced; and this is a matter
which we who enjoy the conveniences of modern
writing and printing can little understand. The
hardships of the <i>scriptorium</i> were greatest, of
course, in winter. There were no fires in the often
damp and ill-lighted cells, and the cold in some of
the parts of Europe where books were produced
must have been very severe. Parchment, the material
generally used for writing upon after the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xii" id="Page_xii"></a>[<a href="./images/xii.png">xii</a>]</span>
seventh century, was at some periods so scarce that
copyists were compelled to resort to the expedient
of effacing the writing on old and less esteemed
manuscripts.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The form of writing was stiff and
regular and therefore exceedingly slow and irksome.</p>

<p>In some of the monasteries the <i>scriptorium</i> was
at least at a later period, conducted more as a matter
of commerce, and making of books became in time
very profitable. The Church continued to hold
the keys of knowledge and to control the means of
productions; but the cloistered cell, where the monk
or the layman, who had a penance to work off for a
grave sin, had worked in solitude, gave way to the
apartment specially set aside, where many persons
could work together, usually under the direction of
a <i>librarius</i> or chief scribe. In the more carefully
constructed monasteries this apartment was so
placed as to adjoin the calefactory, which allowed
the introduction of hot air, when needed.</p>

<p>The seriousness with which the business of
copying was considered is well illustrated by the
consecration of the <i>scriptorium</i> which was often<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiii" id="Page_xiii"></a>[<a href="./images/xiii.png">xiii</a>]</span>
done in words which may be thus translated:
"Vouchsafe, O Lord, to bless this work-room of
thy servants, that all which they write therein may
be comprehended by their intelligence and realized
in their work."</p>

<p>While the work of the scribes was largely that
of copying the scriptures, gospels, and books of
devotion required for the service of the church,
there was a considerable trade in books of a more
secular kind. Particularly was this so in England.
The large measure of attention given to the production
of books of legends and romances was
a distinguishing feature of the literature of England
at least three centuries previous to the invention
of printing. At about the twelfth century
and after, there was a very large production and
sale of books under such headings as chronicles,
satires, sermons, works of science and medicine,
treatises on style, prose romances and epics in
verse. Of course a large proportion of these
were written in or translated from the Latin, the
former indicating a pretty general knowledge of
that language among those who could buy or
read books at all. That this familiarity with
the Latin tongue was not confined to any particular
country is abundantly shown by various
authorities.</p>

<p>Mr. Merryweather, whose book, as has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xiv" id="Page_xiv"></a>[<a href="./images/xiv.png">xiv</a>]</span>
intimated, is only a defense of bibliomania itself as it
actually existed in the middle ages, gives the reader
but scant information as to processes of book-making
at that time. But thanks to the painstaking
research of others, these details are now
a part of the general knowledge of the development
of the book. The following, taken from Mr.
Theodore De Vinne's <i>Invention of Printing</i>, will,
we think, be found interesting:</p>

<p>"The size most in fashion was that now known
as the demy folio, of which the leaf is about ten
inches wide and fifteen inches long, but smaller
sizes were often made. The space to be occupied
by the written text was mapped out with faint
lines, so that the writer could keep his letters on a
line, at even distance from each other and within
the prescribed margin. Each letter was carefully
drawn, and filled in or painted with repeated
touches of the pen. With good taste, black ink
was most frequently selected for the text; red ink
was used only for the more prominent words, and
the catch-letters, then known as the rubricated letters.
Sometimes texts were written in blue, green,
purple, gold or silver inks, but it was soon discovered
that texts in bright color were not so
readable as texts in black.</p>

<p>"When the copyist had finished his sheet he
passed it to the designer, who sketched the border,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xv" id="Page_xv"></a>[<a href="./images/xv.png">xv</a>]</span>
pictures and initials. The sheet was then given to
the illuminator, who painted it. The ornamentation
of a medi&aelig;val book of the first class is beyond
description by words or by wood cuts. Every inch
of space was used. Its broad margins were filled
with quaint ornaments, sometimes of high merit,
admirably painted in vivid colors. Grotesque initials,
which, with their flourishes, often spanned
the full height of the page, or broad bands of
floriated tracery that occupied its entire width,
were the only indications of changes of chapter or
subject. In printer's phrase the composition was
"close-up and solid" to the extreme degree of compactness.
The uncommonly free use of red ink for
the smaller initials was not altogether a matter of
taste; if the page had been written entirely in black
ink it would have been unreadable through its
blackness. This nicety in writing consumed much
time, but the medi&aelig;val copyist was seldom governed
by considerations of time or expense. It was of
little consequence whether the book he transcribed
would be finished in one or in ten years. It was
required only that he should keep at his work
steadily and do his best. His skill is more to be
commended than his taste. Many of his initials
and borders were outrageously inappropriate for
the text for which they were designed. The gravest
truths were hedged in the most childish conceits.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvi" id="Page_xvi"></a>[<a href="./images/xvi.png">xvi</a>]</span>
Angels, butterflies, goblins, clowns, birds, snails and
monkeys, sometimes in artistic, but much oftener
in grotesque and sometimes in highly offensive
positions are to be found in the illuminated borders
of copies of the gospels and writings of the fathers.</p>

<p>"The book was bound by the forwarder, who
sewed the leaves and put them in a cover of leather
or velvet; by the finisher, who ornamented the
cover with gilding and enamel. The illustration
of book binding, published by Amman in his Book
of Trades, puts before us many of the implements
still in use. The forwarder, with his customary
apron of leather, is in the foreground, making use
of a plow-knife for trimming the edges of a book.
The lying press, which rests obliquely against the
block before him, contains a book that has received
the operation of backing-up from a queer shaped
hammer lying upon the floor. The workman at
the end of the room is sewing together the sections
of a book, for sewing was properly regarded as a
man's work, and a scientific operation altogether
beyond the capacity of the raw seamstress. The
work of the finisher is not represented, but the
brushes, the burnishers, the sprinklers and the wheel-shaped
gilding tools hanging against the wall
leave us no doubt as to their use. There is an air
of antiquity about everything connected with this
bookbindery which suggests the thought that its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xvii" id="Page_xvii"></a>[<a href="./images/xvii.png">xvii</a>]</span>
tools and usages are much older than those of
printing. Chevillier says that seventeen professional
bookbinders found regular employment in
making up books for the University of Paris, as
early as 1292. Wherever books were produced in
quantities, bookbinding was set apart as a business
distinct from that of copying.</p>

<p>"The poor students who copied books for their
own use were also obliged to bind them, which
they did in a simple but efficient manner by sewing
together the folded sheets, attaching them to narrow
parchment bands, the ends of which were made
to pass through a cover of stout parchment at the
joint near the back. The ends of the bands were
then pasted down under the stiffening sheet of the
cover, and the book was pressed. Sometimes the
cover was made flexible by the omission of the stiffening
sheet; sometimes the edges of the leaves
were protected by flexible and overhanging flaps
which were made to project over the covers; or by
the insertion in the covers of stout leather strings
with which the two covers were tied together.
Ornamentation was entirely neglected, for a book
of this character was made for use and not for
show. These methods of binding were mostly
applied to small books intended for the pocket;
the workmanship was rough, but the binding was
strong and serviceable."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_xviii" id="Page_xviii"></a>[<a href="./images/xviii.png">xviii</a>]</span></p>

<p>The book of Mr. Merryweather, here reprinted,
is thought worthy of preservation in a series designed
for the library of the booklover. Its publication
followed shortly after that of the works of
Digby and Maitland, but shows much original
research and familiarity with early authorities; and
it is much more than either of these, or of any book
with which we are acquainted, a plea in defense of
bibliomania in the middle ages. Indeed the charm
of the book may be said to rest largely upon the
earnestness with which he takes up his self-imposed
task. One may fancy that after all he found it
not an easy one; in fact his "Conclusion" is a kind
of apology for not having made out a better case.
But this he believes he has proven, "that with all
their superstition, with all their ignorance, their
blindness to philosophic light&mdash;the monks of old
were hearty lovers of books; that they encouraged
learning, fostered it, and transcribed repeatedly the
books which they had rescued from the destruction
of war and time; and so kindly cherished and husbanded
them as intellectual food for posterity.
Such being the case, let our hearts look charitably
upon them; and whilst we pity them for their
superstition, or blame them for their pious frauds,
love them as brother men and workers in the mines
of literature."</p>

diligent search revealed little more than the entry
in the London directory which, in various years from
1840 to 1850, gives his occupation as that of
bookseller, at 14 King Street, Holborn. Indeed
this is shown by the imprint of the title-page of
<i>Bibliomania</i>, which was published in 1849. He
published during the same year <i>Dies Dominic&aelig;</i>,
and in 1850 <i>Glimmerings in the Dark</i>, and <i>Lives
and Anecdotes of Misers</i>. The latter has been
immortalized by Charles Dickens as one of the
books bought at the bookseller's shop by Boffin,
the Golden Dustman, and which was read to him
by the redoubtable Silas Wegg during Sunday
evenings at "Boffin's Bower."<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></p>

<div class="clearfix"><div class="figleft"><img src="./images/ill-3.jpg" alt="I" title="I" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">n</span> recent times, in spite of all those
outcries which have been so repeatedly
raised against the illiterate
state of the dark ages, many and
valuable efforts have been made
towards a just elucidation of those
monkish days. These labors have produced evidence
of what few anticipated, and some even now
deny, viz., that here and there great glimmerings
of learning are perceivable; and although debased,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2"></a>[<a href="./images/2.png">2</a>]</span>
and often barbarous too, they were not quite so
bad as historians have usually proclaimed them. It
may surprise some, however, that an attempt should
be made to prove that, in the olden time in "merrie
Englande," a passion which Dibdin has christened
Bibliomania, existed then, and that there were many
cloistered bibliophiles as warm and enthusiastic in
book collecting as the Doctor himself. But I must
here crave the patience of the reader, and ask him
to refrain from denouncing what he may deem a
rash and futile attempt, till he has perused the
volume and thought well upon the many facts
contained therein. I am aware that many of these
facts are known to all, but some, I believe, are
familiar only to the antiquary&mdash;the lover of musty
parchments and the cobwebbed chronicles of a
monastic age. I have endeavored to bring these
facts together&mdash;to connect and string them into a
continuous narrative, and to extract from them
some light to guide us in forming an opinion on the
state of literature in those ages of darkness and
obscurity; and here let it be understood that I
merely wish to give a fact as history records it. I
will not commence by saying the Middle Ages were
dark and miserably ignorant, and search for some
poor isolated circumstance to prove it; I will not
affirm that this was pre-eminently the age in which
real piety flourished and literature was fondly cherished,
and strive to find all those facts which show
its learning, purposely neglecting those which display
its unlettered ignorance: nor let it be deemed
ostentation when I say that the literary anecdotes
and bookish memoranda now submitted to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3"></a>[<a href="./images/3.png">3</a>]</span>
reader have been taken, where such a course was
practicable, from the original sources, and the references
to the authorities from whence they are derived
have been personally consulted and compared.</p></div>

<p>That the learning of the Middle Ages has been
carelessly represented there can be little doubt:
our finest writers in the paths of history have employed
their pens in denouncing it; some have
allowed difference of opinion as regards ecclesiastical
policy to influence their conclusions; and
because the poor scribes were monks, the most
licentious principles, the most dismal ignorance and
the most repulsive crimes have been attributed to
them. If the monks deserved such reproaches from
posterity, they have received no quarter; if they
possessed virtues as christians, and honorable sentiments
as men, they have met with no reward in
the praise or respect of this liberal age: they were
monks! superstitious priests and followers of Rome!
What good could come of them? It cannot be
denied that there were crimes perpetrated by men
aspiring to a state of holy sanctity; there are
instances to be met with of priests violating the
rules of decorum and morality; of monks revelling
in the dissipating pleasures of sensual enjoyments,
and of nuns whose frail humanity could not maintain
the purity of their virgin vows. But these
instances are too rare to warrant the slanders and
scurrility that historians have heaped upon them.
And when we talk of the sensuality of the monks,
of their gross indulgences and corporeal ease, we
surely do so without discrimination; for when we
speak of the middle ages thus, our thoughts are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4"></a>[<a href="./images/4.png">4</a>]</span>
dwelling on the sixteenth century, its mocking piety
and superstitious absurdity; but in the olden time of
monastic rule, before monachism had burst its ancient
boundaries, there was surely nothing physically attractive
in the austere and dull monotony of a
cloistered life. Look at the monk; mark his hard,
dry studies, and his midnight prayers, his painful
fasting and mortifying of the flesh; what can we
find in this to tempt the epicure or the lover of
indolence and sloth? They were fanatics, blind and
credulous&mdash;I grant it. They read gross legends,
and put faith in traditionary lies&mdash;I grant it; but do
not say, for history will not prove it, that in the
middle ages the monks were wine bibbers and
slothful gluttons. But let not the Protestant reader
be too hastily shocked. I am not defending the
monastic system, or the corruption of the cloister&mdash;far
from it. I would see the usefulness of man
made manifest to the world; but the measure of my
faith teaches charity and forgiveness, and I can find
in the functions of the monk much that must have
been useful in those dark days of feudal tyranny
and lordly despotism. We much mistake the influence
of the monks by mistaking their position; we
regard them as a class, but forget from whence they
sprang; there was nothing aristocratic about them,
as their constituent parts sufficiently testify; they
were, perhaps, the best representatives of the people
that could be named, being derived from all classes
of society. Thus Offa, the Saxon king, and C&aelig;dman,
the rustic herdsman, were both monks. These are
examples by no means rare, and could easily be
multiplied. Such being the case, could not the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5"></a>[<a href="./images/5.png">5</a>]</span>
monks more readily feel and sympathize with all,
and more clearly discern the frailties of their brother
man, and by kind admonition or stern reproof,
mellow down the ferocity of a Saxon nature, or the
proud heart of a Norman tyrant? But our object is
not to analyze the social influence of Monachism in
the middle ages: much might be said against it, and
many evils traced to the sad workings of its evil
spirit, but still withal something may be said in
favor of it, and those who regard its influence in
<i>those days alone</i> may find more to admire and defend
than they expected, or their Protestant prejudices
like to own.</p>

<p>But, leaving these things, I have only to deal
with such remains as relate to the love of books in
those times. I would show the means then in
existence of acquiring knowledge, the scarcity or
plentitude of books, the extent of their libraries,
and the rules regulating them; and bring forward
those facts which tend to display the general
routine of a literary monk, or the prevalence of
Bibliomania in those days.</p>

<p>It is well known that the great national and
private libraries of Europe possess immense collections
of manuscripts, which were produced and
transcribed in the monasteries, during the middle
ages, thousands there are in the rich alcoves of the
Vatican at Rome, unknown save to a choice and
favored few; thousands there are in the royal
library of France, and thousands too reposing on
the dusty shelves of the Bodleian and Cottonian
libraries in England; and yet, these numbers are
but a small portion&mdash;a mere relic&mdash;of the intel<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6"></a>[<a href="./images/6.png">6</a>]</span>lectual
productions of a past and obscure age.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
The barbarians, who so frequently convulsed the
more civilized portions of Europe, found a morbid
pleasure in destroying those works which bore
evidence to the mental superiority of their enemies.
In England, the Saxons, the Danes, and the
Normans were each successively the destroyers of
literary productions. The Saxon Chronicle, that
invaluable repository of the events of so many years,
bears ample testimony to numerous instances of the
loss of libraries and works of art, from fire, or by
the malice of designing foes. At some periods, so
general was this destruction, so unquenchable the
rapacity of those who caused it, that instead of
feeling surprised at the manuscripts of those ages
being so few and scanty, we have cause rather to
wonder that so many have been preserved. For
even the numbers which escaped the hands of the
early and unlettered barbarians met with an equally
ignominious fate from those for whom it would be
impossible to hold up the darkness of their age
as a plausible excuse for the commission of this
egregious folly. These men over whose sad deeds
the bibliophile sighs with mournful regret, were
those who carried out the Reformation, so glorious
in its results; but the righteousness of the means
by which those results were effected are very
equivocal indeed. When men form themselves into
a faction and strive for the accomplishment of one
purpose, criminal deeds are perpetrated with im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7"></a>[<a href="./images/7.png">7</a>]</span>punity,
which, individually they would blush and
scorn to do; they feel no direct responsibility, no
personal restraint; and, such as possess fierce
passions, under the cloak of an organized body,
give them vent and gratification; and those whose
better feelings lead them to contemplate upon these
things content themselves with the conclusion, that
out of evil cometh good.</p>

<p>The noble art of printing was unable, with all
its rapid movements, to rescue from destruction the
treasures of the monkish age; the advocates of the
Reformation eagerly sought for and as eagerly
destroyed those old popish volumes, doubtless
there was much folly, much exaggerated superstition
pervading them; but there was also some truth,
a few facts worth knowing, and perhaps a little
true piety also, and it would have been no difficult
matter to have discriminated between the good and
the bad. But the careless grants of a licentious
monarch conferred a monastery on a court favorite
or political partizan without one thought for the
preservation of its contents. It is true a few years
after the dissolution of these houses, the industrious
Leland was appointed to search and rummage over
their libraries and to preserve any relic worthy of
such an honor; but it was too late, less learned
hands had rifled those parchment collections long
ago, mutilated their finest volumes by cutting out
with childish pleasure the illuminations with which
they were adorned; tearing off the bindings for the
gold claps which protected the treasures within,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8"></a>[<a href="./images/8.png">8</a>]</span>
and chopping up huge folios as fuel for their blazing
hearths, and immense collections were sold as waste
paper. Bale, a strenuous opponent of the monks,
thus deplores the loss of their books: "Never had
we bene offended for the losse of our lybraryes
beynge so many in nombre and in so desolate
places for the moste parte, yf the chief monuments
and moste notable workes of our excellent wryters
had bene reserved, yf there had bene in every shyre
of Englande but one solemyne library to the preservacyon
of those noble workers, and preferrement
of good learnynges in oure posteryte it had bene
yet somewhat. But to destroye all without consyderacion,
is and wyll be unto Englande for ever a
most horryble infamy amonge the grave senyours
of other nations. A grete nombre of them whych
purchased those superstycyose mansyons reserved
of those lybrarye bokes, some to serve theyr jakes,
some to scoure theyr candelstyckes, and some to
rubbe theyr bootes; some they solde to the grossers
and sope sellers, and some they sent over see to the
bokebynders,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> not in small nombre, but at tymes

men who love theyr natyon as they shoulde do."<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a></p>

<p>However pernicious the Roman religion might
have been in its practice, it argues little to the
honor of the reformers to have used such means as
this to effect its cure; had they merely destroyed
those productions connected with the controversies
of the day, we might perhaps have excused it, on
the score of party feeling; but those who were commissioned
to visit the public libraries of the kingdom
were often men of prejudiced intellects and shortsighted
wisdom, and it frequently happened that an
ignorant and excited mob became the executioners
of whole collections.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> It would be impossible now
to estimate the loss. Manuscripts of ancient and
classic date would in their hands receive no more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10"></a>[<a href="./images/10.png">10</a>]</span>
respect than some dry husky folio on ecclesiastical
policy; indeed, they often destroyed the works of
their own party through sheer ignorance. In a
letter sent by Dr. Cox to William Paget, Secretary,
he writes that the proclamation for burning books
had been the occasion of much hurt. "For New
Testaments and Bibles (not condemned by proclamation)
have been burned, and that, out of parish
churches and good men's houses. They have burned
innumerable of the king's majesties books concerning
our religion lately set forth."<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The ignorant
thus delighted to destroy that which they did not
understand, and the factional spirit of the more
enlightened would not allow them to make one
effort for the preservation of those valuable relics
of early English literature, which crowded the
shelves of the monastic libraries; the sign of the
cross, the use of red letters on the title page, the
illuminations representing saints, or the diagrams
and circles of a mathematical nature, were at all
times deemed sufficient evidence of their popish
origin and fitness for the flames.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>When we consider the immense number of MSS.
thus destroyed, we cannot help suspecting that, if
they had been carefully preserved and examined,
many valuable and original records would have been
discovered. The catalogues of old monastic establishments,
although containing a great proportion
of works on divine and ecclesiastical learning, testify<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11"></a>[<a href="./images/11.png">11</a>]</span>
that the monks did not confine their studies exclusively
to legendary tales or superstitious missals,
but that they also cultivated a taste for classical and
general learning. Doubtless, in the ruin of the
sixteenth century, many original works of monkish
authors perished, and the splendor of the transcript
rendered it still more liable to destruction; but I
confess, as old Fuller quaintly says, that "there
were many volumes full fraught with superstition
which, notwithstanding, might be useful to learned
men, except any will deny apothecaries the privilege
of keeping poison in their shops, when they can
make antidotes of them. But besides this, what
beautiful bibles! Rare fathers! Subtle schoolmen!
Useful historians! Ancient! Middle! Modern!
What painful comments were here amongst them!
What monuments of mathematics all massacred
together!"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>More than a cart load of manuscripts were taken
away from Merton College and destroyed, and a
vast number from the Baliol and New Colleges,
Oxford;<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> but these instances might be infinitely
multiplied, so terrible were those intemperate outrages.
All this tends to enforce upon us the
necessity of using considerable caution in forming
an opinion of the nature and extent of learning
prevalent during those ages which preceded the
discovery of the art of printing.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">n</span> this chapter I shall proceed to inquire
into the duties of the monkish
amanuensis, and show by what laws
and regulations the monastic libraries
were governed. The monotonous
habits of a cloistered bibliophile
will, perhaps, appear dry and fastidious, but
still it is curious and interesting to observe how
carefully the monks regarded their vellum tomes,
how indefatigably they worked to increase their
stores, and how eagerly they sought for books.
But besides being regarded as a literary curiosity,
the subject derives importance by the light it throws
on the state of learning in those dark and "bookless"
days, and the illustrations gleaned in this way
fully compensate for the tediousness of the research.</p>

<p>As a bibliophile it is somewhat pleasing to trace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14"></a>[<a href="./images/14.png">14</a>]</span>
a deep book passion growing up in the barrenness
of the cloister, and to find in some cowled monk a
bibliomaniac as warm and enthusiastic in his way
as the renowned "Atticus," or the noble Roxburghe,
of more recent times. It is true we can draw no
comparison between the result of their respective
labors. The hundreds, which in the old time were
deemed a respectable if not an extensive collection,
would look insignificant beside the ostentatious
array of modern libraries.</p></div>

<p>But the very tenor of a monastic life compelled
the monk to seek the sweet yet silent companionship
of books; the rules of his order and the regulations
of his fraternity enforced the strictest silence
in the execution of his daily and never-ceasing
duties. Attending mass, singing psalms, and midnight
prayers, were succeeded by mass, psalms and
prayers in one long undeviating round of yearly
obligations; the hours intervening between these
holy exercises were dull and tediously insupportable
if unoccupied. Conversation forbidden, secular
amusements denounced, yet idleness reproached,
what could the poor monk seek as a relief in this
distress but the friendly book; the willing and
obedient companion of every one doomed to lonely
hours and dismal solitude?</p>

<p>The pride and glory of a monastery was a well
stored library, which was committed to the care of
the armarian, and with him rested all the responsibility
of its preservation. According to the Consuetudines
Canonicorum Regularium, it was his duty
to have all the books of the monastery in his keeping
catalogued and separately marked with their proper<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15"></a>[<a href="./images/15.png">15</a>]</span>
names.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> Some of these old catalogues have been
preserved, and, viewed as bibliographical remains
of the middle ages, are of considerable importance;
indeed, we cannot form a correct idea of the literature
of those remote times without them. Many
productions of authors are recorded in these brief
catalogues whose former existence is only known
to us by these means. There is one circumstance
in connexion with them that must not be forgotten:
instead of enumerating all the works which each
volume contained, they merely specified the first,
so that a catalogue of fifty or a hundred volumes
might probably have contained nearly double that
number of distinct works. I have seen MSS. formerly
belonging to monasteries, which have been
catalogued in this way, containing four or five
others, besides the one mentioned. Designed rather
to identify the book than to describe the contents
of each volume, they wrote down the first word or
two of the second leaf&mdash;this was the most prevalent
usage; but they often adopted other means, sometimes
giving a slight notice of the works which a
volume contained; others took the precaution of
noting down the last word of the last leaf but one,<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>
a great advantage, as the monkish student could
more easily detect at a glance whether the volume
was perfect. The armarian was, moreover, particularly
enjoined to inspect with scrupulous care
the more ancient volumes, lest the moth-worms
should have got at them, or they had become cor<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16"></a>[<a href="./images/16.png">16</a>]</span>rupt
or mutilated, and, if such were the case, he
was with great care to restore them. Probably the
armarian was also the bookbinder to the monastery
in ordinary cases, for he is here directed to cover
the volumes with tablets of wood, that the inside
may be preserved from moisture, and the parchment
from the injurious effects of dampness. The
different orders of books were to be kept separate
from one another, and conveniently arranged; not
squeezed too tight, lest it should injure or confuse
them, but so placed that they might be easily distinguished,
and those who sought them might find
them without delay or impediment.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> Bibliomaniacs
have not been remarkable for their memory or
punctuality, and in the early times the borrower
was often forgetful to return the volume within the
specified time. To guard against this, many rules
were framed, nor was the armarian allowed to lend
the books, even to neighboring monasteries, unless
he received a bond or promise to restore them
within a certain time, and if the person was entirely
unknown, a book of equal value was required as a
security for its safe return. In all cases the armarian
was instructed to make a short memorandum of the
name of the book which he had lent or received.
The "great and precious books" were subject to
still more stringent rules, and although under the
conservation of the librarian, he had not the privilege
of lending them to any one without the distinct
permission of the abbot.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> This was, doubtless,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17"></a>[<a href="./images/17.png">17</a>]</span>
practised by all the monastic libraries, for all generously
lent one another their books. In a collection
of chapter orders of the prior and convent of
Durham, bearing date 1235, it is evident that a
similar rule was observed there, which they were
not to depart from except at the desire of the
bishop.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> According to the constitutions for the
government of the Abingdon monastery, the library
was under the care of the Cantor, and all the writings
of the church were consigned to his keeping.
He was not allowed to part with the books or lend
them without a sufficient deposit as a pledge for
their safe return, except to persons of consequence
and repute.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> This was the practice at a much later
period. When that renowned bibliomaniac, Richard
de Bury, wrote his delightful little book called
<i>Philobiblon</i>, the same rules were strictly in force.
With respect to the lending of books, his own
directions are that, if any one apply for a particular
volume, the librarian was to carefully consider
whether the library contained another copy of it;
if so, he was at liberty to lend the book, taking
care, however, that he obtained a security which
was to exceed the value of the loan; they were at
the same time to make a memorandum in writing
of the name of the book, and the nature of the
security deposited for it, with the name of the
party to whom it was lent, with that of the officer
or librarian who delivered it.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>We learn by the canons before referred to, that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18"></a>[<a href="./images/18.png">18</a>]</span>
the superintendence of all the writing and transcribing,
whether in or out of the monastery, belonged
to the office of the armarian, and that it was
his duty to provide the scribes with parchment and
all things necessary for their work, and to agree
upon the price with those whom he employed. The
monks who were appointed to write in the cloisters
he supplied with copies for transcription; and that
no time might be wasted, he was to see that a
good supply was kept up. No one was to give to
another what he himself had been ordered to
write, or presume to do anything by his own will
or inclination. Nor was it seemly that the armarian
even should give any orders for transcripts
to be made without first receiving the permission
of his superior.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>We here catch a glimpse of the quiet life of a
monkish student, who labored with this monotonous
regularity to amass his little library. If we
dwell on these scraps of information, we shall discover
some marks of a love of learning among
them, and the liberality they displayed in lending
their books to each other is a pleasing trait to
dwell upon. They unhesitatingly imparted to
others the knowledge they acquired by their own
study with a brotherly frankness and generosity
well becoming the spirit of a student. This they
did by extensive correspondence and the temporary
exchange of their books. The system of loan,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19"></a>[<a href="./images/19.png">19</a>]</span>
which they in this manner carried on to a considerable
extent, is an important feature in connection
with our subject; innumerable and interesting
instances of this may be found in the
monastic registers, and the private letters of the
times. The cheapness of literary productions of
the present age render it an absolute waste of
time to transcribe a whole volume, and except with
books of great scarcity we seldom think of borrowing
or lending one; having finished its perusal
we place it on the shelf and in future regard it as
a book of reference; but in those days one volume
did the work of twenty. It was lent to a neighboring
monastery, and this constituted its publication;
for each monastery thus favored, by the aid
perhaps of some half dozen scribes, added a copy
to their own library, and it was often stipulated
that on the return of the original a correct duplicate
should accompany it, as a remuneration to its
author. Nor was the volume allowed to remain
unread; it was recited aloud at meals, or when
otherwise met together, to the whole community.
We shall do well to bear this in mind, and not
hastily judge of the number of students by a comparison
with the number of their books. But it
was not always a mere single volume that the
monks lent from their library. Hunter has printed<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
a list of books lent by the Convent of Henton,
<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1343, to a neighboring monastery, containing
twenty volumes. The engagement to restore these
books was formally drawn up and sealed.</p>

<p>In the monasteries the first consideration was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20"></a>[<a href="./images/20.png">20</a>]</span>
to see that the library was well stored with those
books necessary for the performance of the various
offices of the church, but besides these the library
ought, according to established rules, to contain for
the "edification of the brothers" such as were fit and
needful to be consulted in common study. The
Bible and great expositors; <i>Bibliothec&aelig; et majores
expositores</i>, books of martyrs, lives of saints, homilies,
etc.;<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> these and other large books the monks
were allowed to take and study in private, but the
smaller ones they could only study in the library,
lest they should be lost or mislaid. This was also
the case with respect to the rare and choice
volumes. When the armarian gave out books to
the monks he made a note of their nature, and
took an exact account of their number, so that he
might know in a moment which of the brothers
had it for perusal.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> Those who studied together
were to receive what books they choose; but when
they had satisfied themselves, they were particularly
directed to restore them to their assigned
places; and when they at any time received from
the armarian a book for their private reading, they
were not allowed to lend it to any one else, or to
use it in common, but to reserve it especially for
his own private reading. The same rule extended
to the singers, who if they required books for their
studies, were to apply to the abbot.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> The sick
brothers were also entitled to the privilege of
receiving from the armarian books for their solace<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21"></a>[<a href="./images/21.png">21</a>]</span>
and comfort; but as soon as the lamps were lighted
in the infirmary the books were put away till the
morning, and if not finished, were again given out
from the library.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> In the more ancient monasteries
a similar case was observed with respect to
their books. The rule of St. Pacome directed
that the utmost attention should be paid to their
preservation, and that when the monks went to the
refectory they were not to leave their books open,
but to carefully close and put them in their assigned
places. The monastery of St. Pacome contained
a vast number of monks; every house, says
Mabillon, was composed of not less than forty
monks, and the monastery embraced thirty or forty
houses. Each monk, he adds, possessed his book,
and few rested without forming a library; by which
we may infer that the number of books was considerable.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a>
Indeed, it was quite a common practice
in those days, scarce as books were, to allow
each of the monks one or more for his private
study, besides granting them access to the library.
The constitutions of Lanfranc, in the year 1072,
directed the librarian, at the commencement of
Lent, to deliver a book to each of the monks for
their private reading, allowing them a whole year
for its perusal.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> There is one circumstance connected
with the affairs of the library quite characteristic
of monkish superstition, and bearing painful
testimony to their mistaken ideas of what consti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22"></a>[<a href="./images/22.png">22</a>]</span>tuted
"good works." In Martene's book there is a
chapter, <i>De Scientia et Signis</i>&mdash;degrading and sad;
there is something withal curious to be found in it.
After enjoining the most scrupulous silence in the
church, in the refectory, in the cloister, and in the
dormitory, at all times, and in all seasons; transforming
those men into perpetual mutes, and even
when "actually necessary," permitting only a whisper
to be articulated "in a low voice in the ear,"
<i>submissa voce in aure</i>, it then proceeds to describe
a series of fantastic grimaces which the monks
were to perform on applying to the armarian for
books. The general sign for a book, <i>generali signi
libri</i>, was to "extend the hand and make a movement
as if turning over the leaves of a book." For
a missal the monk was to make a similar movement
with a sign of the cross; for the gospels the sign
of the cross on the forehead; for an antiphon or
book of responses he was to strike the thumb and
little finger of the other hand together; for a book
of offices or gradale to make the sign of a cross
and kiss the fingers; for a tract lay the hand on
the abdomen and apply the other hand to the
mouth; for a capitulary make the general sign
and extend the clasped hands to heaven; for a
psalter place the hands upon the head in the form
of a crown, such as the king is wont to wear.<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a>
Religious intolerance was rampant when this rule
was framed; hot and rancorous denunciation was
lavished with amazing prodigality against works of
loose morality or heathen origin; nor did the
monks feel much compassion&mdash;although they loved<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23"></a>[<a href="./images/23.png">23</a>]</span>
to read them&mdash;for the old authors of antiquity.
Pagans they were, and therefore fit only to be
named as infidels and dogs, so the monk was
directed for a secular book, "which some pagan
wrote after making the general sign to scratch his
ear with his hand, just as a dog itching would do
with his feet, because infidels are not unjustly
compared to such creatures&mdash;<i>quia nec immerito
infideles tali animanti contparantur</i>.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Wretched
bigotry and puny malice! Yet what a sad reflection
it is, that with all the foul and heartburning
examples which those dark ages of the monks
afford, posterity have failed to profit by them&mdash;religious
intolerance, with all its vain-glory and
malice, flourishes still, the cankering worm of
many a Christian blossom! Besides the duties
which we have enumerated, there were others
which it was the province of the armarian to fulfil.
He was particularly to inspect and collate those
books which, according to the decrees of the church,
it was unlawful to possess different from the authorized
copies; these were the bible, the gospels, missals,
epistles, collects graduales, antiphons, hymns, psalters,
lessions, and the monastic rules; these were
always to be alike even in the most minute point.<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a>
He was moreover directed to prepare for the use of
the brothers short tables respecting the times mentioned
in the capitulary for the various offices of
the church, to make notes upon the matins, the
mass, and upon the different orders.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> In fact, the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24"></a>[<a href="./images/24.png">24</a>]</span>
monkish amanuensis was expected to undertake all
those matters which required care and learning
combined. He wrote the letters of the monastery,
and often filled the office of secretary to my Lord
Abbot. In the monasteries of course the services
of the librarian were unrequited by any pecuniary
remuneration, but in the cathedral libraries a certain
salary was sometimes allowed them. Thus we learn
that the amanuensis of the conventual church of
Ely received in the year 1372 forty-three shillings
and fourpence for his annual duties;<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> and Oswald,
Bishop of Worcester, in the tenth century, gave
considerable landed possessions to a monk of that
church as a recompense for his services as librarian.<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>
In some monasteries, in the twelfth century, if not
earlier, they levied a tax on all the members of the
community, who paid a yearly sum to the librarian
for binding, preserving, and purchasing copies for
the library. One of these rules, bearing date 1145,
was made by Udon, Abbot of St. P&egrave;re en Vall&eacute;e &agrave;
Chantres, and that it might be more plausibly
received, he taxed himself as well as all the members
of his own house.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> The librarian sometimes,
in addition to his regular duties, combined the
office of precentor to the monastery.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> Some of
their account-books have been preserved, and by
an inspection of them, we may occasionally gather<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25"></a>[<a href="./images/25.png">25</a>]</span>
some interesting and curious hints, as to the cost
of books and writing materials in those times.
As may be supposed, the monkish librarians often
became great bibliophiles, for being in constant
communication with choice manuscripts, they soon
acquired a great mania for them. Posterity are
also particularly indebted to the pens of these book
conservators of the middle ages; for some of the
best chroniclers and writers of those times were
humble librarians to some religious house.</p>

<p>Not only did the bibliophiles of old exercise
the utmost care in the preservation of their darling
books, but the religious basis of their education
and learning prompted them to supplicate the
blessing of God upon their goodly tomes. Although
I might easily produce other instances, one
will suffice to give an idea of their nature: "O
Lord, send the virtue of thy Holy Spirit upon
these our books; that cleansing them from all
earthly things, by thy holy blessing, they may
mercifully enlighten our hearts and give us true
understanding; and grant that by thy teaching,
they may brightly preserve and make full an abundance
of good works according to thy will."<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">s</span> the monasteries were the schools
of learning, so their occupants were
the preservers of literature, and, as
Herault observes, had they not
taken the trouble to transcribe
books, the ancients had been lost
to us for ever; to them, therefore, we owe much.
But there are many, however, who suppose that
the monastic establishments were hotbeds of superstition
and fanaticism, from whence nothing of a
useful or elevated nature could possibly emanate.
They are too apt to suppose that the human intellect
must be altogether weak and impotent when
confined within such narrow limits; but truth and
knowledge can exist even in the dark cells of a
gloomy cloister, and inspire the soul with a fire
that can shed a light far beyond its narrow pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28"></a>[<a href="./images/28.png">28</a>]</span>cincts.
Indeed, I scarce know whether to regret,
as some appear to do, that the literature and
learning of those rude times was preserved and
fostered by the Christian church; it is said, that
their strict devotion and religious zeal prompted
them to disregard all things but a knowledge of
those divine, but such is not the case; at least, I
have not found it so; it is true, as churchmen, they
were principally devoted to the study of divine and
ecclesiastical lore; but it is also certain that in that
capacity they gradually infused the mild spirit of
their Master among the darkened society over
which they presided, and among whom they shone
as beacons of light in a dreary desert. But the
church did more than this. She preserved to posterity
the profane learnings of Old Greece and
Rome; copied it, multiplied it, and spread it. She
recorded to after generations in plain, simple
language, the ecclesiastical and civil events of the
past, for it is from the terse chronicles of the
monkish churchmen that we learn now the history
of what happened then. Much as we may
dislike the monastic system, the cold, heartless,
gloomy ascetic atmosphere of the cloister, and
much as we may deplore the mental dissipation of
man's best attributes, which the system of those
old monks engendered, we must exercise a cool
and impartial judgment, and remember that what
now would be intolerable and monstrously inconsistent
with our present state of intellectuality,
might at some remote period, in the ages of darkness
and comparative barbarism, have had its virtues
and beneficial influences. As for myself, it<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29"></a>[<a href="./images/29.png">29</a>]</span>
would be difficult to convince me, with all those
fine relics of their deeds before me, those beauteous
fanes dedicated to piety and God, those libraries
so crowded with their vellum tomes, so gorgeously
adorned, and the abundant evidence which history
bears to their known charity and hospitable love,
that these monks and their system was a scheme
of dismal barbarism; it may be so, but my reading
has taught me different; but, on the other hand,
although the monks possessed many excellent
qualities, being the encouragers of literature, the
preservers of books, and promulgators of civilization,
we must not hide their numerous and palpable
faults, or overlook the poison which their
system of monachism <i>ultimately</i> infused into the
very vitals of society. In the early centuries,
before the absurdities of Romanism were introduced,
the influence of the monastic orders was
highly beneficial to our Saxon ancestors, but in
after ages the Church of England was degraded
by the influence of the fast growing abominations
of Popedom. She drank copiously of the deadly
potion, and became the blighted and ghostly
shadow of her former self. Forgetting the humility
of her divine Lord, she sought rather to
imitate the worldly splendor and arrogance of her
Sovereign Pontiff. The evils too obviously existed
to be overlooked; but it is not my place to further
expose them; a more pleasing duty guides my pen;
others have done all this, lashing them painfully
for their oft-told sins. Frail humanity glories in
chastizing the frailty of brother man. But we will
not denounce them here, for did not the day of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30"></a>[<a href="./images/30.png">30</a>]</span>
retribution come? And was not justice satisfied?
Having made these few preliminary remarks, let
us, in a brief manner, inquire into the system observed
in the cloisters by the monks for the preservation
and transcription of manuscripts. Let
us peep into the quiet cells of those old monks,
and see whether history warrants the unqualified
contempt which their efforts in this department
have met with.</p></div>

<p>In most monasteries there were two kinds of
Scriptoria, or writing offices; for in addition to the
large and general apartment used for the transcription
of church books and manuscripts for the
library, there were also several smaller ones occupied
by the superiors and the more learned members
of the community, as closets for private
devotion and study. Thus we read, that in the
Cistercian orders there were places set apart for
the transcription of books called Scriptoria, or
cells assigned to the scribes, "separate from each
other," where the books might be transcribed in
the strictest silence, according to the holy rules of
their founders.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> These little cells were usually
situated in the most retired part of the monastery,
and were probably incapable of accommodating
more than one or two persons;<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> dull and comfortless
places, no doubt, yet they were deemed great
luxuries, and the use of them only granted to such
as became distinguished for their piety, or erudition.
We read that when David went to the Isle of
Wight, to Paulinus, to receive his education, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31"></a>[<a href="./images/31.png">31</a>]</span>
used to sup in the Refectory, but had a Scriptorium,
or study, in his cell, being a famous scribe.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a>
The aged monks, who often lived in these little
offices, separate from the rest of the scribes, were
not expected to work so arduously as the rest.
Their employment was comparatively easy; nor
were they compelled to work so long as those in
the cloister.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> There is a curious passage in Tangmar's
Life of St. Bernward, which would lead us
to suspect that private individuals possessed Scriptoria;
for, says he, there are Scriptoria, not only
in the monasteries, but in other places, in which
are conceived books equal to the divine works of
the philosophers.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> The Scriptorium of the monastery
in which the general business of a literary
nature was transacted, was an apartment far more
extensive and commodious, fitted up with forms and
desks methodically arranged, so as to contain conveniently
a great number of copyists. In some of
the monasteries and cathedrals, they had long
ranges of seats one after another, at which were
seated the scribes, one well versed in the subject
on which the book treated, recited from the copy
whilst they wrote; so that, on a word being given
out by him, it was copied by all.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> The multiplication
of manuscripts, under such a system as this,
must have been immense; but they did not always<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32"></a>[<a href="./images/32.png">32</a>]</span>
make books, <i>fecit libros</i>, as they called it, in this
wholesale manner, but each monk diligently labored
at the transcription of a separate work.</p>

<p>The amount of labor carried on in the Scriptorium,
of course, in many cases depended upon
the revenues of the abbey, and the disposition of
the abbot; but this was not always the case, as in
some monasteries they undertook the transcription
of books as a matter of commerce, and added broad
lands to their house by the industry of their pens.
But the Scriptorium was frequently supported by
resources solely applicable to its use. Laymen,
who had a taste for literature, or who entertained
an esteem for it in others, often at their death
bequeathed estates for the support of the monastic
Scriptoria. Robert, one of the Norman leaders,
gave two parts of the tythes of Hatfield, and the
tythes of Redburn, for the support of the Scriptorium
of St. Alban's.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> The one belonging to the
monastery of St. Edmundsbury was endowed with
two mills,<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> and in the church of Ely there is a
charter of Bishof Nigellus, granting to the Scriptorium
of the monastery the tythes of Wythessey
and Impitor, two parts of the tythes of the Lordship
of Pampesward, with 2s. 2d., and a messuage
in Ely <i>ad faciendos et emandandos libros</i>.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p>The abbot superintended the management of
the Scriptorium, and decided upon the hours for
their labor, during which time they were ordered<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33"></a>[<a href="./images/33.png">33</a>]</span>
to work with unremitting diligence, "not leaving
to go and wander in idleness," but to attend solely
to the business of transcribing. To prevent detraction
or interruption, no one was allowed to
enter except the abbot, the prior, the sub-prior,
and the armarian,<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> as the latter took charge of all
the materials and implements used by the transcribers,
it was his duty to prepare and give them
out when required; he made the ink and cut the
parchment ready for use. He was strictly enjoined,
however, to exercise the greatest economy in supplying
these precious materials, and not to give
more copies "nec artavos, nec cultellos, nec scarpell&aelig;,
nec membranes," than was actually necessary,
or than he had computed as sufficient for the work;
and what the armarian gave them the monks were
to receive without contradiction or contention.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p>The utmost silence prevailed in the Scriptorium;
rules were framed, and written admonitions hung
on the walls, to enforce the greatest care and
diligence in copying exactly from the originals. In
Alcuin's works we find one of these preserved; it is
a piece inscribed "<i>Ad Mus&aelig;um libros scribentium</i>;"
the lines are as follows:</p>

</div></div>

<p>Other means were resorted to besides these to
preserve the text of their books immaculate, it was
a common practice for the scribe at the end of his
copy, to adjure all who transcribed from it to use
the greatest care, and to refrain from the least
alteration of word or sense. Authors more especially
followed this course, thus at the end of some
we find such injunctions as this.</p>

<p>"I adjure you who shall transcribe this book,
by our Lord Jesus Christ and by his glorious
coming, who will come to judge the quick and the
dead, that you compare what you transcribe and
diligently correct it by the copy from which you
transcribe it&mdash;this adjuration also&mdash;and insert it in
your copy."<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a></p>

<p>The Consuetudines Canonicorum, before referred
to, also particularly impressed this upon the
monks, and directed that all the brothers who were
engaged as scribes, were not to alter any writing,
although in their own mind they might think it
proper, without first receiving the sanction of the
abbot, "<i>on no account were they to commit so great
a presumption</i>."<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> But notwithstanding that the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35"></a>[<a href="./images/35.png">35</a>]</span>
scribes were thus enjoined to use the utmost care
in copying books, doubtless an occasional error
crept in, which many causes might have produced,
such as bad light, haste, a little drowsiness, imperfect
sight, or even a flickering lamp was sufficient
to produce some trivial error; but in works of
importance the smallest error is of consequence, as
some future scribe puzzled by the blunder, might,
in an attempt to correct, still more augment the
imperfection; to guard against this, with respect to
the Scriptures, the most critical care was enforced.
Monks advanced in age were alone allowed to
transcribe them, and after their completion they
were read&mdash;revised&mdash;and reread again, and it is by
that means that so uniform a reading has been
preserved, and although slight differences may here
and there occur, there are no books which have
traversed through the shadows of the dark ages,
that preserve their original text so pure and uncorrupt
as the copies of the Scriptures, the fathers
of the church, and the ancient writings of the classic
authors; sometimes, it is true, a manuscript of the
last order is discovered possessing a very different
reading in some particular passage; but these appear
rather as futile emendations or interpolations of the
scribe than as the result of a downright blunder,
and are easily perceivable, for when the monkish
churchmen tampered with ancient copies, it generally
originated in a desire to smooth over the
indecencies of the heathen authors, and so render
them less liable to corrupt the holy contemplations
of the devotee; and while we blame the pious fraud,
we cannot but respect the motive that dictated it.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36"></a>[<a href="./images/36.png">36</a>]</span></p>
<p>But as regards the Scriptures, we talk of the
carelessness of the monks and the interpolations
of the scribes as if these were faults peculiar to the
monastic ages alone; alas! the history of Biblical
transmission tells us differently, the gross perversions,
omissions, and errors wrought in the
holy text, proclaim how prevalent these same
faults have been in the ages of <i>printed literature</i>,
and which appear more palpable by being produced
amidst deep scholars, and surrounded with all the
critical acumen of a learned age. Five or six
thousand of these gross blunders, or these wilful
mutilations, protest the unpleasant fact, and show
how much of human grossness it has acquired,
and how besmeared with corruption those sacred
pages have become in passing through the hands
of man, and the "revisings" of sectarian minds. I
am tempted to illustrate this by an anecdote related
by Sir Nicholas L'Estrange of Hunstanton,
and preserved in a MS. in the Harlein collection.&mdash;"Dr.
Usher, Bish. of Armath, being to preach
at Paules Crosse and passing hastily by one of the
stationers, called for a Bible, and had a little one
of the London edition given him out, but when he
came to looke for his text, that very verse was
omitted in the print: which gave the first occasion
of complaint to the king of the insufferable negligence,
and insufficience of the London printers
and presse, and bredde that great contest that
followed, betwixt the univers. of Cambridge and
London stationers, about printing of the Bibles."<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37"></a>[<a href="./images/37.png">37</a>]</span>
Gross and numerous indeed were the errors of the
corrupt bible text of that age, and far exceeding
even the blunders of monkish pens, and certainly
much less excusable, for in those times they seldom
had a large collection of codices to compare, so
that by studying their various readings, they could
arrive at a more certain and authentic version.
The paucity of the sacred volume, if it rendered
their pens more liable to err, served to enforce
upon them the necessity of still greater scrutiny.
On looking over a monastic catalogue, the first
volume that I search for is the Bible; and, I feel
far more disappointment if I find it not there, than
I do at the absence of Horace or Ovid&mdash;there is
something so desolate in the idea of a Christian
priest without the Book of Life&mdash;of a minister of
God without the fountain of truth&mdash;that however
favorably we may be prone to regard them, a
thought will arise that the absence of this sacred
book may perhaps be referred to the indolence of
the monkish pen, or to the laxity of priestly piety.
But such I am glad to say was not often the case;
the Bible it is true was an expensive book, but can
scarcely be regarded as a rare one; the monastery
was indeed poor that had it not, and when once
obtained the monks took care to speedily transcribe
it. Sometimes they only possessed detached
portions, but when this was the case they generally
borrowed of some neighboring and more fortunate
monastery, the missing parts to transcribe, and so
complete their own copies. But all this did not
make the Bible less loved among them, or less
anxiously and ardently studied, they devoted their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38"></a>[<a href="./images/38.png">38</a>]</span>
days, and the long hours of the night, to the
perusal of those pages of inspired truth,<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> and it is
a calumny without a shadow of foundation to declare
that the monks were careless of scripture
reading; it is true they did not apply that vigor
of thought, and unrestrained reflection upon it
which mark the labors of the more modern student,
nor did they often venture to interpret the
hidden meaning of the holy mysteries by the
powers of their own mind, but were guided in this
important matter by the works of the fathers. But
hence arose a circumstance which gave full exercise
to their mental powers and compelled the
monk in spite of his timidity to think a little for
himself. Unfortunately the fathers, venerable and
venerated as they were, after all were but men,
with many of the frailties and all the fallabilities
of poor human nature; the pope might canonize
them, and the priesthood bow submissively to
their spiritual guidance, still they remained for all
that but mortals of dust and clay, and their bulky
tomes yet retain the swarthiness of the tomb about
them, the withering impress of humanity. Such
being the case we, who do not regard them quite
so infallible, feel no surprise at a circumstance
which sorely perplexed the monks of old, they unchained
and unclasped their cumbrous "Works of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39"></a>[<a href="./images/39.png">39</a>]</span>
the Fathers," and pored over those massy expositions
with increasing wonder; surrounded by
these holy guides, these fathers of infallibility,
they were like strangers in a foreign land, did they
follow this holy saint they seemed about to forsake
the spiritual direction of one having equal
claims to their obedience and respect; alas! for
poor old weak tradition, those fabrications of man's
faulty reason were found, with all their orthodoxy,
to clash woefully in scriptural interpretation. Here
was a dilemma for the monkish student! whose
vow of obedience to patristical guidance was thus
sorely perplexed; he read and re-read, analyzed
passage after passage, interpreted word after word;
and yet, poor man, his laborious study was fruitless
and unprofitable! What bible student can refrain
from sympathizing with him amidst these torturing
doubts and this crowd of contradiction, but after
all we cannot regret this, for we owe to it more
than my feeble pen can write, so immeasurable
have been the fruits of this little unheeded circumstance.
It gave birth to many a bright independent
declaration, involving pure lines of scripture
interpretation, which appear in the darkness of
those times like fixed stars before us; to this, in
Saxon days, we are indebted for the labors of
&AElig;lfric and his anti-Roman doctrines, whose soul
also sympathized with a later age by translating
portions of the Bible into the vulgar tongue, thus
making it accessible to all classes of the people.
To this we are indebted for all the good that resulted
from those various heterodoxies and heresies,
which sometimes disturbed the church during the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40"></a>[<a href="./images/40.png">40</a>]</span>
dark ages; but which wrought much ultimate
good by compelling the thoughts of men to dwell
on these important matters. Indeed, to the instability
of the fathers, as a sure guide, we may
trace the origin of all those efforts of the human
mind, which cleared the way for the Reformation,
and relieved man from the shackles of these spiritual
guides of the monks.</p>

<p>But there were many cloistered Christians who
studied the bible undisturbed by these shadows
and doubts, and who, heedless of patristical lore
and saintly wisdom, devoured the spiritual food
in its pure and uncontaminating simplicity&mdash;such
students, humble, patient, devoted, will be
found crowding the monastic annals, and yielding
good evidence of the same by the holy tenor
of their sinless lives, their Christian charity and
love.</p>

<p>But while so many obtained the good title of
an "<i>Amator Scripturarum</i>," as the bible student
was called in those monkish days, I do not pretend
to say that the Bible was a common book among
them, or that every monk possessed one&mdash;far different
indeed was the case&mdash;a copy of the Old
and New Testament often supplied the wants of
an entire monastery, and in others, as I have said
before, only some detached portions were to be
found in their libraries. Sometimes they were
more plentiful, and the monastery could boast of
two or three copies, besides a few separate portions,
and occasionally I have met with instances
where besides several <i>Biblia Optima</i>, they enjoyed
Hebrew codices and translations, with numerous<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41"></a>[<a href="./images/41.png">41</a>]</span>
copies of the gospels. We must not forget, however,
that the transcription of a Bible was a work
of time, and required the outlay of much industry
and wealth. "Brother Tedynton," a monk of Ely,
commenced a Bible in 1396, and was several years
before he completed it. The magnitude of the
undertaking can scarcely be imagined by those
unpractised in the art of copying, but when the
monk saw the long labor of his pen before him,
and looked upon the well bound strong clasped
volumes, with their clean vellum folios and fine
illuminations, he seemed well repaid for his years
of toil and tedious labor, and felt a glow of pious
pleasure as he contemplated his happy acquisition,
and the comfort and solace which he should hereafter
derive from its holy pages! We are not
surprised then, that a Bible in those days should
be esteemed so valuable, and capable of realizing a
considerable sum. The monk, independent of its
spiritual value, regarded it as a great possession,
worthy of being bestowed at his death, with all the
solemnity of a testamentary process, and of being
gratefully acknowledged by the fervent prayers of
the monkish brethren. Kings and nobles offered
it as an appropriate and generous gift, and bishops
were deemed benefactors to their church by adding
it to the library. On its covers were written
earnest exhortations to the Bible student, admonishing
the greatest care in its use, and leveling
anathemas and excommunications upon any one
who should dare to purloin it. For its greater
security it was frequently chained to a reading
desk, and if a duplicate copy was lent to a neigh<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42"></a>[<a href="./images/42.png">42</a>]</span>boring
monastery they required a large deposit, or
a formal bond for its safe return.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> These facts,
while they show its value, also prove how highly
it was esteemed among them, and how much the
monks loved the Book of Life.</p>

<p>But how different is the picture now&mdash;how opposite
all this appears to the aspect of bible propagation
in our own time. Thanks to the printing-press,
to bible societies, and to the benevolence of God,
we cannot enter the humblest cottage of the poorest
peasant without observing the Scriptures on his
little shelf&mdash;not always read, it is true&mdash;nor always
held in veneration as in the old days before us&mdash;its
very plentitude and cheapness takes off its attraction
to irreligious and indifferent readers, but to poor
and needy Christians what words can express the
fulness of the blessing. Yet while we thank God
for this great boon, let us refrain from casting uncharitable
reflections upon the monks for its comparative
paucity among them. If its possession was
not so easily acquired, they were nevertheless true
lovers of the Bible, and preserved and multiplied it
in dark and troublous times.</p>

<p>Our remarks have hitherto applied to the monastic
scribes alone; but it is necessary here to speak
of the secular copyists, who were an important class
during the middle ages, and supplied the functions
of the bibliopole of the ancients. But the transcribing
trade numbered three or four distinct bran<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43"></a>[<a href="./images/43.png">43</a>]</span>ches.
There were the Librarii Antiquarii, Notarii,
and the Illuminators&mdash;occasionally these professions
were all united in one&mdash;where perseverance or talent
had acquired a knowledge of these various arts.
There appears to have been considerable competition
between these contending bodies. The notarii were
jealous of the librarii, and the librarii in their turn
were envious of the antiquarii, who devoted their
ingenuity to the transcription and repairing of old
books especially, rewriting such parts as were
defective or erased, and restoring the dilapidations
of the binding. Being learned in old writings they
corrected and revised the copies of ancient codices;
of this class we find mention as far back as the time
of Cassiodorus and Isidore.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> "They deprived,"
says Astle, "the poor librarii, or common scriptores,
of great part of their business, so that they found it
difficult to gain a subsistence for themselves and
their families. This put them about finding out
more expeditious methods of transcribing books.
They formed the letters smaller, and made use of
more conjugations and abbreviations than had been
usual. They proceeded in this manner till the
letters became exceedingly small and extremely
difficult to be read."<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> The fact of there existing a
class of men, whose fixed employment or profession
was solely confined to the transcription of ancient
writings and to the repairing of tattered copies, in
contradistinction to the common scribes, and depending
entirely upon the exercise of their art as a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44"></a>[<a href="./images/44.png">44</a>]</span>
means of obtaining a subsistence, leads us to the
conclusion that ancient manuscripts were by no
means so very scarce in those days; for how absurd
and useless it would have been for men to qualify
themselves for transcribing these antiquated and
venerable codices, if there had been no probability
of obtaining them to transcribe. The fact too of its
becoming the subject of so much competition proves
how great was the demand for their labor.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>We are unable, with any positive result, to discover
the exact origin of the secular scribes, though
their existence may probably be referred to a very
remote period. The monks seem to have monopolized
for some ages the "<i>Commercium Librorum</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a>
and sold and bartered copies to a considerable
extent among each other. We may with some
reasonable grounds, however, conjecture that the
profession was flourishing in Saxon times; for we
find several eminent names in the seventh and
eighth centuries who, in their epistolary correspondence,
beg their friends to procure transcripts
for them. Benedict, Bishop of Wearmouth, purchased
most of his book treasures at Rome, which
was even at that early period probably a famous
mart for such luxuries, as he appears to have
journeyed there for that express purpose. Some of
the books which he collected were presents from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45"></a>[<a href="./images/45.png">45</a>]</span>
his foreign friends; but most of them, as Bede tells
us, were <i>bought</i> by himself, or in accordance with
his instructions, by his friends.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Boniface, the
Saxon missionary, continually writes for books to
his associates in all parts of Europe. At a subsequent
period the extent and importance of the
profession grew amazingly; and in Italy its followers
were particularly numerous in the tenth century, as
we learn from the letters of Gerbert, afterwards
Silvester II., who constantly writes, with the cravings
of a bibliomaniac, to his friends for books, and begs
them to get the scribes, who, he adds, in one of his
letters, may be found in all parts of Italy,<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> both in
town and in the country, to make transcripts of
certain books for him, and he promises to reimburse
his correspondent all that he expends for the same.</p>

<p>These public scribes derived their principal employment
from the monks and the lawyers; from
the former in transcribing their manuscripts, and
by the latter in drawing up their legal instruments.
They carried on their avocation at their own homes
like other artisans; but sometimes when employed
by the monks executed their transcripts within the
cloister, where they were boarded, lodged, and
received their wages till their work was done. This
was especially the case when some great book was
to be copied, of rarity and price; thus we read of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46"></a>[<a href="./images/46.png">46</a>]</span>
Paulinus, of St. Albans, sending into distant parts
to obtain proficient workmen, who were paid so
much per diem for their labor; their wages were
generously supplied by the Lord of Redburn.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a></p>

<p>The increase of knowledge and the foundation
of the universities gave birth to the booksellers.
Their occupation as a distinct trade originated at a
period coeval with the foundation of these public
seminaries, although the first mention that I am
aware of is made by Peter of Blois, about the year
1170. I shall have occasion to speak more hereafter
of this celebrated scholar, but I may be excused for
giving the anecdote here, as it is so applicable to
my subject. It appears, then, that whilst remaining
in Paris to transact some important matter for the
King of England, he entered the shop of "a public
dealer in books"&mdash;for be it known that the archdeacon
was always on the search, and seldom missed
an opportunity of adding to his library&mdash;the bookseller,
Peter tells us, offered him a tempting collection
on Jurisprudence; but although his knowledge
of such matters was so great that he did not require
them for his own use, he thought they might be
serviceable to his nephew, and after bargaining a
little about the price he counted down the money
agreed upon and left the stall; but no sooner was
his back turned than the Provost of Sexeburgh
came in to look over the literary stores of the
stationer, and his eye meeting the recently sold
volume, he became inspired with a wish to possess
it; nor could he, on hearing it was bought and
paid for by another, suppress his anxiety to obtain<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47"></a>[<a href="./images/47.png">47</a>]</span>
the treasure; but, offering more money, actually
took the volume away by force. As may be supposed,
Archdeacon Peter was sorely annoyed at
this behavior; and "To his dearest companion
and friend Master Arnold of Blois, Peter of Blois
Archdeacon of Bath sent greeting," a long and
learned letter, displaying his great knowledge of
civil law, and maintaining the illegality of the provost's
conduct.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> The casual way in which this is
mentioned make it evident that the "<i>publico mangone
Librorum</i>" was no unusual personage in those
days, but belonged to a common and recognized
profession.</p>

<p>The vast number of students who, by the foundation
of universities, were congregated together,
generated of course a proportionate demand for
books, which necessity or luxury prompted them
eagerly to purchase: but there were poor as well
as rich students educated in these great seminaries
of learning, whose pecuniary means debarred them
from the acquisition of such costly luxuries; and
for this and other cogent reasons the universities
deemed it advantageous, and perhaps expedient, to
frame a code of laws and regulations to provide
alike for the literary wants of all classes and degrees.
To effect this they obtained royal sanction
to take the trade entirely under their protection,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48"></a>[<a href="./images/48.png">48</a>]</span>
and eventually monopolized a sole legislative power
over the <i>Librarii</i>.</p>

<p>In the college of Navarre a great quantity of
ancient documents are preserved, many of which
relate to this curious subject. They were deposited
there by M. Jean Aubert in 1623, accompanied by
an inventory of them, divided into four parts by
the first four letters of the alphabet. In the
fourth, under D. 18, there is a chapter entitled
"Des Libraires Appretiateurs, Jurez et Enlumineurs,"
which contains much interesting matter relating
to the early history of bookselling.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> These
ancient statutes, collected and printed by the University
in the year 1652,<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> made at various times,
and ranging between the years 1275 and 1403,
give us a clear insight into the matter.</p>

<p>The nature of a bookseller's business in those
days required no ordinary capacity, and no shallow
store of critical acumen; the purchasing of manuscripts,
the work of transcription, the careful revisal,
the preparation of materials, the tasteful illuminations,
and the process of binding, were each employments
requiring some talent and discrimination,
and we are not surprised, therefore, that the avocation
of a dealer and fabricator of these treasures<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49"></a>[<a href="./images/49.png">49</a>]</span>
should be highly regarded, and dignified into a
profession, whose followers were invested with all
the privileges, freedoms and exemptions, which the
masters and students of the university enjoyed.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a>
But it required these conciliations to render the
restrictive and somewhat severe measures, which
she imposed on the bookselling trade, to be received
with any degree of favor or submission. For whilst
the University of Paris, by whom these statutes
were framed, encouraged and elevated the profession
of the librarii, she required, on the other hand,
a guarantee of their wealth and mental capacity,
to maintain and to appreciate these important concessions;
the bookseller was expected indeed to be
well versed in all branches of science, and to be
thoroughly imbued with a knowledge of those subjects
and works of which he undertook to produce
transcripts.<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> She moreover required of him testimonials
to his good character, and efficient security,
ratified by a solemn oath of allegiance,<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and a promise
to observe and submit to all the present and
future laws and regulations of the university. In
some cases, it appears that she restricted the number
of librarii, though this fell into disuse as the
wants of the students increased. Twenty-four seems
to have been the original number,<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> which is sufficiently
great to lead to the conclusion that bookselling
was a flourishing trade in those old days.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50"></a>[<a href="./images/50.png">50</a>]</span>
By the statutes of the university, the bookseller
was not allowed to expose his transcripts for sale,
without first submitting them to the inspection
of certain officers appointed by the university, and
if an error was discovered, the copies were ordered
to be burnt or a fine levied on them, proportionate
to their inaccuracy. Harsh and stringent
as this may appear at first sight, we shall modify
our opinion, on recollecting that the student was
in a great degree dependent upon the care of the
transcribers for the fidelity of his copies, which
rendered a rule of this nature almost indispensable;
nor should we forget the great service it bestowed
in maintaining the primitive accuracy of ancient
writers, and in transmitting them to us through
those ages in their original purity.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>In these times of free trade and unrestrained
commercial policy, we shall regard less favorably a
regulation which they enforced at Paris, depriving
the bookseller of the power of fixing a price upon
his own goods. Four booksellers were appointed
and sworn in to superintend this department, and
when a new transcript was finished, it was brought
by the bookseller, and they discussed its merits and
fixed its value, which formed the amount the bookseller
was compelled to ask for it; if he demanded
of his customer a larger sum, it was deemed a
fraudulent imposition, and punishable as such.
Moreover, as an advantage to the students, the
bookseller was expected to make a considerable
reduction in his profits in supplying them with
books; by one of the laws of the university, his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51"></a>[<a href="./images/51.png">51</a>]</span>
profit on each volume was confined to four deniers
to student, and six deniers to a common purchaser.
The librarii were still further restricted in the economy
of their trade, by a rule which forbade any
one of them to dispose of his entire stock of books
without the consent of the university; but this, I
suspect, implied the disposal of the stock and trade
together, and was intended to intimate that the introduction
of the purchaser would not be allowed,
without the cognizance and sanction of the university.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
Nor was the bookseller able to purchase
books without her consent, lest they should be of
an immoral or heretical tendency; and they were
absolutely forbidden to buy any of the students,
without the permission of the rector.</p>

<p>But restricted as they thus were, the book merchants
nevertheless grew opulent, and transacted
an important and extensive trade; sometimes they
purchased parts and sometimes they had whole
libraries to sell.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> Their dealings were conducted
with unusual care, and when a volume of peculiar
rarity or interest was to be sold, a deed of conveyance
was drawn up with legal precision, in the presence
of authorized witnesses.</p>

<p>In those days of high prices and book scarcity,
the poor student was sorely impeded in his progress;
to provide against these disadvantages, they
framed a law in 1342, at Paris, compelling all
public booksellers to keep books to lend out on
hire. The reader will be surprised at the idea of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52"></a>[<a href="./images/52.png">52</a>]</span>
a circulating library in the middle ages! but there
can be no doubt of the fact, they were established
at Paris, Toulouse, Vienna, and Bologne. These
public librarians, too, were obliged to write out regular
catalogues of their books and hang them up
in their shops, with the prices affixed, so that the
student might know beforehand what he had to
pay for reading them. I am tempted to give a few
extracts from these lists:</p>


<ul><li>St. Gregory's Commentaries upon Job, for reading 100 pages, 8 sous.</li>
<li>St. Gregory's Book of Homilies, 28 pages for 12 deniers.</li>
<li>Isidore's De Summa bona, 24 pages, 12 deniers.</li>
<li>Anselm's De Veritate de Libertate Arbitrii, 40 pages, 2 sous.</li>
<li>Peter Lombard's Book of Sentences, 3 sous.</li>
<li>Scholastic History, 3 sous.</li>
<li>Augustine's Confessions, 21 pages, 4 deniers.</li>
<li>Gloss on Matthew, by brother Thomas Aquinas, 57 pages, 3 sous.</li>
<li>Bible Concordance, 9 sous.</li>
<li>Bible, 10 sous.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></li>
</ul>

<p>This rate of charge was also fixed by the
university, and the students borrowing these books
were privileged to transcribe them if they chose;
if any of them proved imperfect or faulty, they
were denounced by the university, and a fine imposed
upon the bookseller who had lent out the
volume.</p>

<p>This potent influence exercised by the universities
over booksellers became, in time, much
abused, and in addition to these commercial
restraints, they assumed a still less warrantable<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53"></a>[<a href="./images/53.png">53</a>]</span>
power over the original productions of authors;
and became virtually the public censors of books,
and had the power of burning or prohibiting any
work of questionable orthodoxy. In the time of
Henry the Second, a book was published by being
read over for two or three successive days, before
one of the universities, and if they approved of its
doctrines and bestowed upon it their approbation,
it was allowed to be copied extensively for sale.</p>

<p>Stringent as the university rules were, as
regards the bookselling trade, they were, nevertheless,
sometimes disregarded or infringed; some
ventured to take more for a book than the sum
allowed, and, by prevarication and secret contracts,
eluded the vigilance of the laws.<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> Some were
still bolder, and openly practised the art of a scribe
and the profession of a bookseller, without knowledge
or sanction of the university. This gave
rise to much jealousy, and in the University of
Oxford, in the year 1373, they made a decree
forbidding any person exposing books for sale
without her licence.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>Now, considering all these usages of early bookselling,
their numbers, their opulence, and above
all, the circulating libraries which the librarii
established, can we still retain the opinion that
books were so inaccessible in those ante-printing
days, when we know that for a few sous the booklover
could obtain good and authenticated copies
to peruse, or transcribe? It may be advanced that
these facts solely relate to universities, and were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54"></a>[<a href="./images/54.png">54</a>]</span>
intended merely to insure a supply of the necessary
books in constant requisition by the students,
but such was not the case; the librarii were
essentially public <i>Librorum Venditores</i>, and were
glad to dispose of their goods to any who could
pay for them. Indeed, the early bibliomaniacs
usually flocked to these book marts to rummage
over the stalls, and to collect their choice volumes.
Richard de Bury obtained many in this way, both
at Paris and at Rome.</p>

<p>Of the exact pecuniary value of books during
the middle ages, we have no means of judging.
The few instances that have accidentally been
recorded are totally inadequate to enable us to
form an opinion. The extravagant estimate given
by some as to the value of books in those days is
merely conjectural, as it necessarily must be, when
we remember that the price was guided by the
accuracy of the transcription, the splendor of the
binding, which was often gorgeous to excess, and
by the beauty and richness of the illuminations.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a>
Many of the manuscripts of the middle ages are
magnificent in the extreme. Sometimes they
inscribed the gospels and the venerated writings of
the fathers with liquid gold, on parchment of the
richest purple,<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> and adorned its brilliant pages
with illuminations of exquisite workmanship.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55"></a>[<a href="./images/55.png">55</a>]</span></p><p>The first specimens we have of an attempt to
embellish manuscripts are Egyptian. It was a
common practice among them at first to color the
initial letter of each chapter or division of their
work, and afterwards to introduce objects of various
kinds into the body of the manuscript.</p>

<p>The splendor of the ancient calligraphical productions
of Greece,<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and the still later ones of
Rome, bear repeated testimony that the practice of
this art had spread during the sixth century, if not
earlier, to these powerful empires. England was
not tardy in embracing this elegant art. We have
many relics of remote antiquity and exquisite workmanship
existing now, which prove the talent and
assiduity of our early Saxon forefathers.</p>

<p>In Ireland the illuminating art was profusely
practised at a period as early as the commencement
of the seventh century, and in the eighth we find it
holding forth eminent claims to our respect by the
beauty of their workmanship, and the chastity of
their designs. Those well versed in the study of
these ancient manuscripts have been enabled, by
extensive but minute observation, to point out their
different characteristics in various ages, and even
to decide upon the school in which a particular
manuscript was produced.</p>

<p>These illuminations, which render the early
manuscripts of the monkish ages so attractive,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56"></a>[<a href="./images/56.png">56</a>]</span>
generally exemplify the rude ideas and tastes of
the time. In perspective they are wofully deficient,
and manifest but little idea of the picturesque or
sublime; but here and there we find quite a gem of
art, and, it must be owned, we are seldom tired by
monotony of coloring, or paucity of invention. A
study of these parchment illustrations afford considerable
instruction. Not only do they indicate
the state of the pictorial art in the middle ages,
but also give us a comprehensive insight into the
scriptural ideas entertained in those times; and the
bible student may learn much from pondering on
these glittering pages; to the historical student,
and to the lover of antiquities, they offer a verdant
field of research, and he may obtain in this way
many a glimpse of the manners and customs of
those old times which the pages of the monkish
chroniclers have failed to record.</p>

<p>But all this prodigal decoration greatly enhanced
the price of books, and enabled them to
produce a sum, which now to us sounds enormously
extravagant. Moreover, it is supposed that the
scarcity of parchment limited the number of books
materially, and prevented their increase to any
extent; but I am prone to doubt this assertion, for
my own observations do not help to prove it. Mr.
Hallam says, that in consequence of this, "an unfortunate
practice gained ground of erasing a manuscript
in order to substitute another on the same
skin. This occasioned, probably, the loss of many
ancient authors who have made way for the legends
of saints, or other ecclesiastical rubbish."<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> But we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57"></a>[<a href="./images/57.png">57</a>]</span>
may reasonably question this opinion, when we
consider the value of books in the middle ages, and
with what esteem the monks regarded, in spite of
all their paganism, those "heathen dogs" of the
ancient world. A doubt has often forced itself upon
my mind when turning over the "crackling leaves"
of many ancient MSS., whether the peculiarity
mentioned by Montfaucon, and described as parchment
from which former writing had been erased,
may not be owing, in many cases, to its mode of
preparation. It is true, a great proportion of the
membrane on which the writings of the middle ages
are inscribed, appear rough and uneven, but I could
not detect, through many manuscripts of a hundred
folios&mdash;all of which evinced this roughness&mdash;the unobliterated
remains of a single letter. And when I
have met with instances, they appear to have been
short writings&mdash;perhaps epistles; for the monks
were great correspondents, and, I suspect, kept
economy in view, and often carried on an epistolary
intercourse, for a considerable time, with a very
limited amount of parchment, by erasing the letter
to make room for the answer. This, probably, was
usual where the matter of their correspondence
was of no especial importance; so that, what our
modern critics, being emboldened by these faint
traces of former writing, have declared to possess
the classic appearance of hoary antiquity, may be
nothing more than a complimentary note, or the
worthless accounts of some monastic expenditure.
But, careful as they were, what would these monks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58"></a>[<a href="./images/58.png">58</a>]</span>
have thought of "paper-sparing Pope," who wrote
his Iliad on small pieces of refuse paper? One of
the finest passages in that translation, which describes
the parting of Hector and Andromache, is
written on part of a letter which Addison had
franked, and is now preserved in the British
Museum. Surely he could afford, these old monks
would have said, to expend some few shillings for
paper, on which to inscribe that for which he was
to receive his thousand pounds.</p>

<p>But far from the monastic manuscripts displaying
a scantiness of parchment, we almost invariably find
an abundant margin, and a space between each line
almost amounting to prodigality; and to say that
the "vellum was considered more precious than the
genius of the author,"<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> is absurd, when we know
that, in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries, a
dozen skins of parchment could be bought for sixpence;
whilst that quantity written upon, if the
subject possessed any interest at all, would fetch
considerably more, there always being a demand
and ready sale for books.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> The supposition, therefore,
that the monastic scribes erased <i>classical</i>
manuscripts for the sake of the material, seems
altogether improbable, and certainly destitute of
proof. It is true, many of the classics, as we have
them now, are but mere fragments of the original<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59"></a>[<a href="./images/59.png">59</a>]</span>
work. For this, however, we have not to blame
the monks, but barbarous invaders, ravaging flames,
and the petty animosities of civil and religious
warfare for the loss of many valuable works of the
classics. By these means, one hundred and five
books of Livy have been lost to us, probably forever.
For the thirty which have been preserved, our
thanks are certainly due to the monks. It was from
their unpretending and long-forgotten libraries that
many such treasures were brought forth at the
revival of learning, in the fifteenth century, to
receive the admiration of the curious, and the study
of the erudite scholar. In this way Poggio Bracciolini
discovered many inestimable manuscripts.
Leonardo Aretino writes in rapturous terms on
Poggio's discovery of a perfect copy of Quintillian.
"What a precious acquisition!" he exclaims, "what
unthought of pleasure to behold Quintillian perfect
and entire!"<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> In the same letter we learn that
Poggio had discovered Asconius and Flaccus in the
monastery of St. Gall, whose inhabitants regarded
them without much esteem. In the monastery of
Langres, his researches were rewarded by a copy of
Cicero's Oration for C&aelig;cina. With the assistance
of Bartolomeo di Montepulciano, he discovered
Silius Italicus, Lactantius, Vegetius, Nonius Marcellus,
Ammianus Marcellus, Lucretius, and Columella,
and he found in a monastery at Rome a
complete copy of Turtullian.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> In the fine old
monastery of Casino, so renowned for its classical
library in former days, he met with Julius Frontinus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60"></a>[<a href="./images/60.png">60</a>]</span>
and Firmicus, and transcribed them with his own
hand. At Cologne he obtained a copy of Petronius
Arbiter. But to these we may add Calpurnius's
Bucolic,<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a> Manilius, Lucius Septimus, Coper, Eutychius,
and Probus. He had anxious hopes of
adding a perfect Livy to the list, which he had been
told then existed in a Cistercian Monastery in
Hungary, but, unfortunately, he did not prosecute
his researches in this instance with his usual energy.
The scholar has equally to regret the loss of a
perfect Tacitus, which Poggio had expectations of
from the hands of a German monk. We may still
more deplore this, as there is every probability that
the monks actually possessed the precious volume.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a>
Nicolas of Treves, a contemporary and friend of
Poggio's, and who was infected, though in a slight
degree, with the same passionate ardor for collecting
ancient manuscripts, discovered, whilst exploring
the German monasteries, twelve comedies
of Plautus, and a fragment of Aulus Gellius.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> Had
it not been for the timely aid of these great men,
many would have been irretrievably lost in the many
revolutions and contentions that followed; and, had
such been the case, the monks, of course, would
have received the odium, and on their heads the
spleen of the disappointed student would have been
prodigally showered.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">n</span> the foregoing chapters I have endeavored
to give the reader an insight into the means by
which the monks multiplied their books, the opportunities
they had of obtaining them, the rules of
their libraries and scriptoria, and the duties of a
monkish librarian. I now proceed to notice some
of the English monastic libraries of the middle
ages, and by early records and old manuscripts
inquire into their extent, and revel for a time
among the bibliomaniacs of the cloisters. On the
spot where Christianity&mdash;more than twelve hundred
years ago&mdash;first obtained a permanent footing in
Britain, stands the proud metropolitan cathedral of
Canterbury&mdash;a venerable and lasting monument of
ancient piety and monkish zeal. St. Augustine,
who brought over the glad tidings of the Christian
faith in the year 596, founded that noble structure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62"></a>[<a href="./images/62.png">62</a>]</span>
on the remains of a church which Roman Christians
in remote times had built there. To write the
literary history of its old monastery would spread
over more pages than this volume contains, so
many learned and bookish abbots are mentioned in
its monkish annals. Such, however, is beyond the
scope of my present design, and I have only to turn
over those ancient chronicles to find how the love
of books flourished in monkish days; so that, whilst
I may here and there pass unnoticed some ingenious
author, or only casually remark upon his talents,
all that relate to libraries or book-collecting, to
bibliophiles or scribes, I shall carefully record; and,
I think, from the notes now lying before me, and
which I am about to arrange in something like
order, the reader will form a very different idea of
monkish libraries than he previously entertained.</p></div>

<p>The name that first attracts our attention in the
early history of Canterbury Church is that of
Theodore of Tarsus, the father of Anglo-Saxon
literature, and certainly the first who introduced
bibliomania into this island; for when he came on
his mission from Rome in the year 668 he brought
with him an extensive library, containing many
Greek and Latin authors, in a knowledge of which
he was thoroughly initiated. Bede tells us that
he was well skilled in metrical art, astronomy, arithmetic,
church music, and the Greek and Latin
languages.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> At his death<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> the library of Christ<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63"></a>[<a href="./images/63.png">63</a>]</span>
Church Monastery was enriched by his valuable
books, and in the time of old Lambarde some of
them still remained. He says, in his quaint way,
"The Reverend Father Mathew, nowe Archbishop
of Canterburie, whose care for the conservation of
learned monuments can never be sufficiently commended,
shewed me, not long since, the Psalter of
David, and sundrie homilies in Greek; Homer also
and some other Greeke authors beautifully wrytten
on thicke paper, with the name of this Theodore
prefixed in the fronte, to whose librarie he reasonably
thought, being thereto led by shew of great
antiquitie that they sometimes belonged."<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a></p>

<p>Tatwine was a great book lover, if not a bibliomaniac.
"He was renowned for religious wisdom,
and notably learned in Sacred Writ."<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> If he wrote
the many pieces attributed to him, his pen must
have been prolific and his reading curious and
diversified. He is said to have composed on profane
and sacred subjects, but his works were unfortunately
destroyed by the Danish invaders, and a book
of poems and one of enigmas are all that have
escaped their ravages. The latter work, preserved
in our National Library, contains many curious
hints, illustrative of the manners of those remote
days.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>

<p>Nothelm, or the Bold Helm, succeeded this
interesting author; he was a learned and pious
priest of London. The bibliomaniac will somewhat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64"></a>[<a href="./images/64.png">64</a>]</span>
envy the avocation of this worthy monk whilst
searching over the rich treasures of the Roman
archives, from whence he gleaned much valuable
information to aid Bede in compiling his history of
the English Church.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> Not only was he an industrious
scribe but also a talented author, if we are to
believe Pits, who ascribes to him several works,
with a Life of St. Augustine.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a></p>

<p>It is well known that St. Dunstan was an ingenious
scribe, and so passionately fond of books, that
we may unhesitatingly proclaim him a bibliomaniac.
He was a native of Wessex, and resided with his
father near Glastonbury Abbey, which holy spot
many a legendary tale rendered dear to his youthful
heart. He entered the Abbey, and devoted his
whole time to reading the wondrous lives and
miracles of ascetic men till his mind became excited
to a state of insanity by the many marvels and
prodigies which they unfolded; so that he acquired
among the simple monks the reputation of one
holding constant and familiar intercourse with the
beings of another world. On his presentation to
the king, which was effected by the influence of
his uncle Athelm, Archbishop of Canterbury, he
soon became a great favorite, but excited so much
jealousy there, that evil reports were industriously
spread respecting him. He was accused of
practising magical arts and intriguing with the
devil. This induced him to retire again into the
seclusion of a monastic cell, which he constructed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65"></a>[<a href="./images/65.png">65</a>]</span>
so low that he could scarcely stand upright in
it. It was large enough, however, to hold his
forge and other apparatus, for he was a proficient
worker in metals, and made ornaments, and bells
for his church. He was very fond of music,
and played with exquisite skill upon the harp.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a>
But what is more to our purpose, his biographer
tells us that he was remarkably skilful in writing
and illuminating, and transcribed many books,
adorning them with beautiful paintings, whilst in
this little cell.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> One of them is preserved in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford. On the front is a
painting of St. Dunstan kneeling before our Saviour,
and at the top is written "<i>Pictura et Scriptura
hujus pagine subtas visi est de propria manu sei
Dunstani</i>."<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> But in the midst of these ingenious
pursuits he did not forget to devote many hours to
the study of the Holy Scriptures, as also to the
diligent transcription and correction of copies of
them,<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and thus arming himself with the sacred
word, he was enabled to withstand the numerous
temptations which surrounded him. Sometimes
the devil appeared as a man, and at other times he
was still more severely tempted by the visitations
of a beautiful woman, who strove by the most
alluring blandishments to draw that holy man from
the paths of Christian rectitude. In the tenth
century such eminent virtues could not pass un<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66"></a>[<a href="./images/66.png">66</a>]</span>rewarded,
and he was advanced to the Archbishopric
of Canterbury in the year 961, but his after life
is that of a saintly politician, and displays nothing
that need be mentioned here.</p>

<p>In the year 969,<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> &AElig;lfric, abbot of St. Alban's,
was elected archbishop of Canterbury. His identity
is involved in considerable doubt by the many
contemporaries who bore that name, some of
whom, like him, were celebrated for their talent
and erudition; but, leaving the solution of this
difficulty to the antiquarian, we are justified in
saying that he was of noble family, and received
his education under Ethelwold, at Abingdon, about
the year 960. He accompanied his master to Winchester,
and Elphegus, bishop of that see, entertained
so high an opinion of &AElig;lfric's learning
and capacity, that he sent him to superintend the
recently founded monastery of Cerne, in Devonshire.
He there spent all his hours, unoccupied
by the duties of his abbatical office, in the transcription
of books and the nobler avocations of an
author. He composed a Latin Grammar, a work
which has won for him the title of "<i>The Grammarian</i>,"
and he greatly helped to maintain the
purity of the Christian church by composing a
large collection of homilies, which became exceedingly
popular during the succeeding century, and
are yet in existence. The preface to these homilies
contain several very curious passages illustrative of
the mode of publication resorted to by the monkish
authors, and on that account I am tempted to make
the following extracts:</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67"></a>[<a href="./images/67.png">67</a>]</span></p>
<p>"I, &AElig;lfric, the scholar of Ethelwold, to the courteous
and venerable Bishop Sigeric, in the Lord.</p>

<p>"Although it may appear to be an attempt of
some rashness and presumption, yet have I ventured
to translate this book out of the Latin writers, especially
those of the 'Holy Scriptures,' into our common
language; for the edification of the ignorant,
who only understand this language when it is either
read or heard. Wherefore I have not used obscure
or unintelligible words, but given the plain English.
By which means the hearts, both of the readers and
of the hearers, may be reached more easily; because
they are incapable of being otherwise instructed,
than in their native tongue. Indeed, in our translation,
we have not ever been so studious to render
word for word, as to give the true sense and
meaning of our authors. Nevertheless, we have
used all diligent caution against deceitful errors,
that we may not be found seduced by any heresy,
nor blinded by any deceit. For we have followed
these authors in this translation, namely, St. Austin
of Hippo, St. Jerome, Bede, Gregory, Smaragdus,
and sometimes Haymo, whose authority is admitted
to be of great weight with all the faithful. Nor
have we only expounded the treatise of the gospels;...
but have also described the passions and
lives of the saints, for the use of the unlearned of
this nation. We have placed forty discourses in
this volume, believing this will be sufficient for one
year, if they be recited entirely to the faithful, by
the ministers of the Lord. But the other book
which we have now taken in hand to compose
will contain those passions or treatises which are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68"></a>[<a href="./images/68.png">68</a>]</span>
omitted in this volume." ... "Now, if any one find
fault with our translation, that we have not always
given word for word, or that this translation is not
so full as the treatise of the authors themselves, or
that in handling of the gospels we have run them
over in a method not exactly conformable to the
order appointed in the church, let him compose a
book of his own; by an interpretation of deeper
learning, as shall best agree with his understanding,
this only I beseech him, that he may not pervert
this version of mine, which I hope, by the grace of
God, without any boasting, I have, according to
the best of my skill, performed with all diligence.
Now, I most earnestly entreat your goodness, my
most gentle father Sigeric, that you will vouchsafe
to correct, by your care, whatever blemishes of
malignant heresy, or of dark deceit, you shall meet
with in my translation, and then permit this little
book to be ascribed to your authority, and not
to the meanness of a person of my unworthy
character. Farewell in the Almighty God continually.
Amen."<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>I have before alluded to the care observed by
the scribes in copying their manuscripts, and the
moderns may deem themselves fortunate that they
did so; for although many interpolations, or emendations,
as they called them, occur in monkish transcripts,
on the whole, their integrity, in this respect,
forms a redeeming quality in connexion with their
learning. In another preface, affixed to the second
collection of his homilies, &AElig;lfric thus explains his
design in translating them:<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69"></a>[<a href="./images/69.png">69</a>]</span></p>

<p>"&AElig;lfric, a monk and priest, although a man of
less abilities than are requisite for one in such
orders, was sent, in the days of King &AElig;thelred,
from Alphege, the bishop and successor of &AElig;thelwold,
to a monastery which is called Cernel, at the
desire of &AElig;thelmer, the Thane, whose noble birth
and goodness is everywhere known. Then ran it
in my mind, I trust, through the grace of God,
that I ought to translate this book out of the
Latin tongue into the English language not upon
presumption of great learning, but because I saw
and heard much error in many English books,
which ignorant men, through their simplicity, esteemed
great wisdom, and because it grieved me
that they neither knew, nor had the gospel learning
in their writing, except from those men that understood
Latin, and those books which are to be had
of King Alfred's, which he skilfully translated from
Latin into English."<a name="FNanchor_101_101" id="FNanchor_101_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a></p>

<p>From these extracts we may gain some idea of
the state of learning in those days, and they would
seem, in some measure, to justify the opinion, that
the laity paid but little attention to such matters,
and I more anxiously present the reader with these
scraps, because they depict the state of literature
in those times far better than a volume of conjecture
could do. It is not consistent with my design
to enter into an analysis of these homilies. Let
the reader, however, draw some idea of their nature
from the one written for Easter Sunday, which has
been deemed sufficient proof that the Saxon Church
ever denied the Romish doctrine of transubstanti<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70"></a>[<a href="./images/70.png">70</a>]</span>ation;
for he there expressly states, in terms so
plain that all the sophistry of the Roman Catholic
writers cannot pervert its obvious meaning, that
the bread and wine is only typical of the body and
blood of our Saviour.</p>

<p>To one who has spent much time in reading
the lives and writings of the monkish theologians,
how refreshing is such a character as that of &AElig;lfric's.
Often, indeed, will the student close the volumes
of those old monastic writers with a sad, depressed,
and almost broken heart; so often will he find men
who seem capable of better things, who here and
there breathe forth all the warm aspirations of a
devout and Christian heart, bowed down and
grovelling in the dust, as it were, to prove their
blind submission to the Pope, thinking, poor fellows!&mdash;for
from my very heart I pity them&mdash;that
by so doing they were preaching that humility so
acceptable to the Lord.</p>

<p>Cheering then, to the heart it is to find this
monotony broken by such an instance, and although
we find &AElig;lfric occasionally diverging into the paths
of papistical error, he spreads a ray of light over
the gloom of those Saxon days, and offers pleasing
evidence that Christ never forsook his church;
that even amidst the peril and darkness of those
monkish ages there were some who mourned,
though it might have been in a monastery, submissive
to a Roman Pontiff, the depravity and corruption
with which the heart of man had marred it.</p>

<p>To still better maintain the discipline of the
church, he wrote a set of canons, which he addressed
to Wulfin, or Wulfsine, bishop of Sher<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71"></a>[<a href="./images/71.png">71</a>]</span>bourne.
With many of the doctrines advocated
therein, the protestant will not agree; but the
bibliophile will admit that he gave an indication of
his love of books by the 21st Canon, which directs
that, "Before a priest can be ordained, he must be
armed with the sacred books, for the spiritual
battle, namely, a Psalter, Book of Epistles, Book of
Gospels, the Missal Book, Books of Hymns, the
Manual, or Euchiridion, the Gerim, the Passional,
the P&aelig;nitential, and the Lectionary, or Reading
Book; these the diligent priest requires, and let
him be careful that they are all accurately written,
and free from faults."<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a></p>

<p>About the same time, &AElig;lfric wrote a treatise
on the Old and New Testaments, and in it we find
an account of his labors in Biblical Literature. He
did more in laying open the holy mysteries of the
gospel to the perusal of the laity, by translating
them into the Saxon tongue, than any other before
him. He gave them, in a vernacular version, the
Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, Esther, Job, Judith,
two Books of Maccabees, and a portion of the
Book of Kings, and it is for these labors, above
all others, that the bible student will venerate his
name, but he will look, perhaps, anxiously, hopefully,
to these early attempts at Bible propagation,
and expect to observe the ecclesiastical orders, at
least, shake off a little of their absurd dependence
on secondary sources for biblical instruction. But,
no; they still sadly clung to traditional interpretation;
they read the Word of God mystified by
the fathers, good men, many of them, devout<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72"></a>[<a href="./images/72.png">72</a>]</span>
and holy saints, but why approach God through
man, when we have His own prescription, in sweet
encouraging words, to come, however humble or
lowly we may be, to His throne, and ask with our
own lips for those blessings so needful for the soul.
&AElig;lfric, in a letter addressed to Sigwerd, prefixed
to his Treatise on the Old and New Testament,
thus speaks of his biblical labors:</p>

<p>"Abbot Elfricke greeteth friendly, Sigwerd at
last Heolon. True it is I tell thee that very wise is
he who speaketh by his doings; and well proceedeth
he doth with God and the world who furnisheth
himselfe with good works. And very plaine it is
in holy scripture, that holy men employed in well
doing were in this world held in good reputation,
and as saints now enjoy the kingdom of heaven,
and the remembrance of them continueth for ever,
because of their consent with God and relying on
him, carelesse men who lead their life in all idleness
and so end it, the memory of them is forgotten in
holy writ, saving that the Old Testament records
their ill deeds and how they were therefore comdemned.
Thou hast oft entreated me for English
Scripture .... and when I was with thee great mone
thou madest that thou couldst get none of my
writings. Now will I that thou have at least this
little, since knowledge is so acceptable to thee, and
thou wilt have it rather than be altogether without
my books...... God bestoweth sevenfold grace on
mankind, (whereof I have already written in another
English Treatise,) as the prophet Isaiah hath
recorded in the book of his prophesie." In speaking
of the remaining books of the Pentateuch, he does<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73"></a>[<a href="./images/73.png">73</a>]</span>
so in a cursory manner, and excuses himself because
he had "written thereof more at large."
"The book which Moses wrote, called the book of
Joshua, sheweth how he went with the people of
Israel unto Abraham's country, and how he won it,
and how the sun stood still while he got the victory,
and how he divided the land; this book also I
turned into English for prince Ethelverd, wherein
a man may behold the great wonders of God really
fulfilled." ...... "After him known it is that there were
in the land certaine judges over Israel, who guided
the people as it is written in the book of Judges .....
of this whoso hath desire to hear further, may read
it in that English book which I translated concerning
the same." ..... "Of the book of Kings, I
have translated also some part into English," "the
book of Esther, I briefly after my manner translated
into English," and "The Widow Judith who
overcame Holophernes, the Syrian General, hath
her book also, among these, concerning her own
victory and <i>Englished according to my skill for
your example</i>, that ye men may also defend your
country by force of arms, against the invasion of a
foreign host." "Two books of Machabeus, to the
glory of God, I have turned also into English, and
so read them, you may if you please, for your instruction."
And at the end we find him again admonishing
the scribes to use the pen with faithfulness.
"Whosoever," says he, "shall write out this
book, let him write it according to the copy, and
for God's love correct it, that it be not faulty, less
he thereby be discredited, and I shent."<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74"></a>[<a href="./images/74.png">74</a>]</span></p>
<p>This learned prelate died on the 16th of November,
1006, after a life spent thus in the service of
Christ and the cause of learning; by his will he
bequeathed to the Abbey of St. Alban's, besides
some landed possessions, his little library of books;<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a>
he was honorably buried at Abingdon, but during
the reign of Canute, his bones were removed to
Canterbury.</p>

<p>Passing on a few years, we come to that period
when a new light shone upon the lethargy of the
Saxons; the learning and erudition which had been
fostering in the snug monasteries of Normandy,
hitherto silent&mdash;buried as it were&mdash;but yet fast
growing to maturity, accompanied the sword of the
Norman duke, and added to the glory of the conquering
hero, by their splendid intellectual endowments.
All this emulated and roused the Saxons
from their slumber; and, rubbing their laziness
away, they again grasped the pen with the full nerve
and energy of their nature; a reaction ensued,
literature was respected, learning prospered, and
copious work flowed in upon the scribes; the crackling
of parchment, and the din of controversy
bespoke the presence of this revival in the cloisters
of the English monasteries; books, the weapons
spiritual of the monks, libraries, the magazines of
the church militant were preserved, amassed, and at
last deemed indispensable.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> Such was the effect on<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75"></a>[<a href="./images/75.png">75</a>]</span>
our national literature of that gushing in of the
Norman conquerors, so deeply imbued with learning,
so polished, and withal so armed with classical
and patristic lore were they.</p>

<p>Foremost in the rank we find the learned Lanfranc,
that patron of literature, that indefatigable
scribe and anxious book collector, who was endowed
with an erudition far more deep and comprehensive
than any other of his day. He was born at Pavia,
in 1005, and received there the first elements of his
education;<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> he afterwards went to Bologna, and from
thence to Avranches, where he undertook the education
of many celebrated scholars of that century,
and instructed them in sacred and secular learning,
<i>in sacris et secularibus erudivi literis</i>.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> Whilst proceeding
on a journey to Rome he was attacked by
some robbers, who maltreated and left him almost
dead; in this condition he was found by some
peasants who conveyed him to the monastery of
Bec; the monks with their usual hospitable charity
tended and so assiduously nourished him in his
sickness, that on his recovery he became one of
their fraternity. A few years after, he was appointed
prior and founded a school there, which did
immense service to literature and science; he also
collected a great library which was renowned
and esteemed in his day,<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> and he increased their
value by a critical revisal of their text. He was
well aware that in works so voluminous as those of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76"></a>[<a href="./images/76.png">76</a>]</span>
the fathers, the scribes through so many generations
could not be expected to observe an unanimous
infallibility; but knowing too that even the most
essential doctrines of the holy and catholic church
were founded on patristical authority, he was deeply
impressed with the necessity of keeping their writings
in all their primitive integrity; an end so
desirable, well repaid the tediousness of the undertaking,
and he cheerfully spent much time in collecting
and comparing codices, in studying their
various readings or erasing the spurious interpolations,
engendered by the carelessness or the
pious frauds of monkish scribes.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> He lavished his
care in a similar manner on the Bible: considering
the far distant period from which that holy volume
has descended to us, it is astounding that the vicissitudes,
the perils, the darkness of near eighteen
hundred years, have failed to mar the divinity of
that sacred book; not all the blunders of nodding
scribes could do it, not all the monkish interpolations,
or the cunning of sectarian pens could do it,
for in all times the faithful church of Christ watched
over it with a jealous care, supplied each erasure
and expelled each false addition. Lanfranc was
one of the most vigilant of these Scripture guards,
and his own industry blest his church with the bible
text, purified from the gross handmarks of human
meddling. I learn, from the Benedictines of St.
Maur, that there is still preserved in the Abbey of
St. Martin de S&eacute;cz, the first ten conferences of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77"></a>[<a href="./images/77.png">77</a>]</span>
Cassian corrected by the efficient hand of this great
critical student, at the end of the manuscript these
words are written, "<i>Hucusque ago Lanfrancus correxi</i>."<a name="FNanchor_110_110" id="FNanchor_110_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_110_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a>
The works of St. Ambrose, on which he
bestowed similar care, are preserved in the library
of St. Vincent du Mans.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a></p>

<p>When he was promoted to the See of Canterbury,
he brought with him a copious supply of
books, and spread the influence of his learning over
the English monasteries; but with all the cares
inseparably connected with the dignity of Primate
of England, he still found time to gratify his bookloving
propensities, and to continue his critical
labors; indeed he worked day and night in the
service of the church, <i>servitio Ecclesi&aelig;</i>, and in correcting
the books which the scribes had written.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>
From the profusion of his library he was enabled
to lend many volumes to the monks, so that by
making transcripts, they might add to their own
stores&mdash;thus we know that he lent to Paulen, Abbot
of St. Albans, a great number, who kept his scribes
hard at work transcribing them, and built a scriptorium
for the transaction of these pleasing labors;
but more of this hereafter.</p>

<p>Anselm, too, was a renowned and book-loving
prelate, and if his pride and haughtiness wrought
warm dissensions and ruptures in the church, he
often stole away to forget them in the pages of his
book. At an early age he acquired this fondness<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78"></a>[<a href="./images/78.png">78</a>]</span>
for reading, and whilst engaged as a monkish
student, he applied his mind to the perusal of
books with wonderful perseverance, and when some
favorite volume absorbed his attention, he could
scarce leave it night or day.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Industry so indefatigable
ensured a certain success, and he became
eminent for his deep and comprehensive learning;
his epistles bear ample testimony to his extensive
reading and intimate acquaintance with the authors
of antiquity;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> in one of his letters he praises a
monk named Maurice, for his success in study,
who was learning <i>Virgil</i> and some other old writers,
under Arnulph the grammarian.</p>

<p>All day long Anselm was occupied in giving
wise counsel to those that needed it; and a great
part of the night <i>pars maxima noctis</i> he spent in
correcting his darling volumes, and freeing them
from the inaccuracies of the scribes.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> The oil in
the lamp burnt low, still that bibliomaniac studiously
pursued his favorite avocation. So great
was the love of book-collecting engrafted into his
mind, that he omitted no opportunity of obtaining
them&mdash;numerous instances occur in his epistles of
his begging the loan of some volume for transcription;<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a>
in more than one, I think, he asks for portions
of the Holy Scriptures which he was always
anxious to obtain to compare their various readings,
and to enable him with greater confidence to correct
his own copies.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79"></a>[<a href="./images/79.png">79</a>]</span></p><p>In the early part of the twelfth century, the
monks of Canterbury transcribed a vast number of
valuable manuscripts, in which they were greatly
assisted by monk Edwine, who had arrived at considerable
proficiency in the calligraphical art, as a
volume of his transcribing, in Trinity college, Cambridge,
informs us;<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> it is a Latin Psalter, with a
Saxon gloss, beautifully illuminated in gold and
colors; at the end appears the figure of the monkish
scribe, holding the pen in his hand to indicate his
avocation, and an inscription extols his ingenuity
in the art.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>Succeeding archbishops greatly enriched the
library at Canterbury. Hubert Walter, who was
appointed primate in 1191, gave the proceeds of
the church of Halgast to furnish books for the
library;<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and Robert Kildwardly, archbishop in
1272, a man of great learning and wisdom, a
remarkable orator and grammarian, wrote a great
number of books, and was passionately fond of
collecting them.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>I learn from Wanley, that there is a large folio
manuscript in the library of Trinity Hall, Cambridge,
written about the time of Henry V. by a monk of
St. Augustine's Abbey, Canterbury, containing the
history of Christ Church; this volume proves its
author to have been something of a bibliophile,
and that is why I mention it, for he gives an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80"></a>[<a href="./images/80.png">80</a>]</span>
account of some books then preserved, which were
sent over by Pope Gregory to St. Augustine; these
precious volumes consisted of a Bible in two
volumes, called "Biblia Gregorian," beautifully
written, with some of the leaves tinted with purple
and rose-color, and the capital letters rubricated.
This interesting and venerable MS. so immediately
connected with the first ages of the Christian
church of Britain, was in existence in the time of
James I., as we learn by a passage in a scarce tract
entitled "A Petition Apologetical," addressed by
the Catholics to his majesty, where, as a proof that
we derive our knowledge of Scripture originally
from the church of Rome; they say, "The very
original Bible, the self-same <i>Numero</i> which St.
Gregory sent in with our apostle, St. Augustine,
being as yet reserved by God's special providence,
as testimony that what Scriptures we have, we had
them from Rome.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>He next mentions two Psalters, one of which I
have seen; it is among the manuscripts in the Cotton
collection,<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> and bears full evidence of its great
antiquity. This early gem of biblical literature
numbers 160 folios; it contains the Roman Psalter,
with a Saxon interlinear translation, written on
stout vellum, in a clear, bold hand. On opening
the volume, we find the first page enriched with a
dazzling specimen of monkish skill&mdash;it is a painting
of our Saviour pointing with his right hand to
heaven, and in his left holding the sacred book;
the corners are occupied with figures of animals,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81"></a>[<a href="./images/81.png">81</a>]</span>
and the whole wrought on a glittering ground
work, is rendered still more gorgeous by the contrast
which the purple robes of Jesus display; on
the reverse of this fine illumination there is a beautiful
tesselated ornament, interwoven with animals,
flowers, and grotesque figures, around which are
miniatures of our Saviour, David, and some of the
apostles. In a line at the bottom the word <span class="smcap">Catvsvir</span>
is inscribed. Very much inferior to this in point of
art is the illumination, at folio 31, representing
David playing his harp, surrounded by a musical
coterie; it is probably the workmanship of a more
modern, but less skilful scribe of the Saxon school.
The smaller ornaments and initial letters throughout
the manuscript display great intricacy of
design.</p>

<p>The writer next describes two copies of the
Gospels, both now in the Bodleian Collection at
Oxford. A Passionarium Sanctorum, a book for
the altar, on one side of which was the image of
our Saviour wrought in gold, and lastly, an exposition
of the Epistles and Gospels; the monkish
bookworm tells us that these membraneous treasures
were the most ancient books in all the
churches of England.<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a></p>

<p>A good and liberal monk, named Henry De
Estria, who was elected prior in the year 1285, devoted
both his time and wealth to the interests of
his monastery, and is said to have expended &pound;900
in repairing the choir and chapter-house.<a name="FNanchor_124_124" id="FNanchor_124_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82"></a>[<a href="./images/82.png">82</a>]</span>
wrote a book beginning, "<i>Memoriale Henerici
Prioris Monasteri Xpi Cantuari&aelig;</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_125_125" id="FNanchor_125_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a> now preserved
in the Cotton collection; it contains the most
extensive monastic catalogue I had ever seen, and
sufficiently proves how Bibliomania flourished in
that noble monastery. It occupies no less than
thirty-eight treble-columned folio pages, and contains
the titles of more than three thousand works.
To attempt to convey to the reader an idea of this
curious and sumptuous library, without transcribing
a large proportion of its catalogue, I am afraid
will be a futile labor; but as that would occupy
too much space, and to many of my readers be,
after all, dry and uninteresting, I shall merely give
the names of some of the most conspicuous. Years
indeed it must have required to have amassed a
collection so brilliant and superb in those days of
book scarcity. Surprise and wonder almost surpass
the admiration we feel at beholding this proud
testimonial of monkish industry and early bibliomania.
Many a choice scribe, and many an <i>Amator
Librorum</i> must have devoted his pen and purse to
effect so noble an acquisition. Like most of the
monastic libraries, it possessed a great proportion
of biblical literature&mdash;copies of the Bible whole
and in parts, commentaries on the same, and numerous
glossaries and concordances show how
much care the monks bestowed on the sacred
writings, and how deeply they were studied in
those old days. In patristic learning the library
was unusually rich, embracing the most eminent
and valuable writings of the Fathers, as may be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83"></a>[<a href="./images/83.png">83</a>]</span>
seen by the following names, of whose works the
catalogue enumerates many volumes:</p>


<ul><li>Augustine.</li>
<li>Ambroise.</li>
<li>Anselm.</li>
<li>Alcuin.</li>
<li>Aldelm.</li>
<li>Benedict.</li>
<li>Bernard.</li>
<li>Bede.</li>
<li>Beranger.</li>
<li>Chrysostom.</li>
<li>Eusebius.</li>
<li>Fulgentius.</li>
<li>Gregory.</li>
<li>Hillarius.</li>
<li>Isidore.</li>
<li>Jerome.</li>
<li>Lanfranc.</li>
<li>Origen.</li>
</ul>

<p>Much as we may respect them for all this, our
gratitude will materially increase when we learn
how serviceable the monks of Canterbury were in
preserving the old dead authors of Greece and
Rome. We do not, from the very nature of their
lives being so devoted to religion and piety, expect
this; and knowing, too, what "heathen dogs" the
monks thought these authors of idolatry, combined
with our notion, that they, far from being
the conservers, were the destroyers, of classic
MSS., for the sake, as some tell us, of the parchment
on which they were inscribed, we are somewhat
staggered in our opinion to find in their
library the following brilliant array of the wise
men of the ancient world:</p>


<ul><li>Aristotle,</li>
<li>Boethius,</li>
<li>Cicero,</li>
<li>Cassiodorus,</li>
<li>Donatus,</li>
<li>Euclid,</li>
<li>Galen,</li>
<li>Justin,</li>
<li>Josephus,</li>
<li>Lucan,</li>
<li>Martial,</li>
<li>Marcianus,</li>
<li>Macrobius,</li>
<li>Orosius,</li>
<li>Plato,</li>
<li>Priscian,</li>
<li>Prosper,</li>
<li>Prudentius,</li>
<li>Suetonius,</li>
<li>Sedulus,</li>
<li>Seneca,</li>
<li>Terence,</li>
<li>Virgil,</li>
<li>Etc., etc.</li>
</ul>

<p>Nor were they mere fragments of these authors,
but, in many cases, considerable collections; of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84"></a>[<a href="./images/84.png">84</a>]</span>
Aristotle, for instance, they possessed numerous
works, with many commentaries upon him. Of
Seneca a still more extensive and valuable one;
and in the works of the eloquent Tully, they were
also equally rich. Of his <i>Paradoxa, de Senectute,
de Amiticia</i>, etc., and <i>his Offices</i>, they had more
copies than one, a proof of the respect and esteem
with which he was regarded. In miscellaneous
literature, and in the productions of the middle
age writers, the catalogue teems with an abundant
supply, and includes:</p>


<ul><li>Rabanus Maurus,</li>
<li>Thomas Aquinas,</li>
<li>Peter Lombard,</li>
<li>Athelard,</li>
<li>William of Malmsbury,</li>
<li>John of Salisbury,</li>
<li>Girald Barry,</li>
<li>Thomas Baldwin,</li>
<li>Brutus,</li>
<li>Robert Grosetete,</li>
<li>Gerlandus,</li>
<li>Gregory Nazianzen,</li>
<li>History of England,</li>
<li>Gesti Alexandri Magni,</li>
<li>Hystoria Longobardos,</li>
<li>Hystori&aelig; Scholastic&aelig;,</li>
<li>Chronicles <i>Latine et Anglice</i>,</li>
<li>Chronographia Necephori.</li>
</ul>

<p>But I trust the reader will not rest satisfied with
these few samples of the goodly store, but inspect
the catalogue for himself. It would occupy, as I
said before, too much space to enumerate even a
small proportion of its many treasures, which treat
of all branches of literature and science, natural
history, medicine, ethics, philosophy, rhetoric, grammar,
poetry, and music; each shared the studious
attention of the monks, and a curious "<i>Liber de
Astronomia</i>" taught them the rudiments of that
sublime science, but which they were too apt to
confound with its offspring, astrology, as we may
infer, was the case with the monks of Canterbury,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85"></a>[<a href="./images/85.png">85</a>]</span>
for their library contained a "<i>Liber de Astrol&#339;bus</i>,"
and the "Prophesies of Merlin."</p>

<p>Many hints connected with the literary portion
of a monastic life may sometimes be found in these
catalogues. It was evidently usual at Christ Church
Monastery to keep apart a number of books for
the private study of the monks in the cloister,
which I imagine they were at liberty to use at any
time.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>A portion of the catalogue of monk Henry is
headed "<i>Lib. de Armariole Claustre</i>,"<a name="FNanchor_127_127" id="FNanchor_127_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> under which it
is pleasing to observe a Bible, in two volumes, specified
as for the use of the infirmary, with devotional
books, lives of the fathers, a history of England,
the works of Bede, Isidore, Boethius, Rabanus
Maurus, Cassiodorus, and many others of equal
celebrity. In another portion of the manuscript,
we find a list of their church books, written at the
same time;<a name="FNanchor_128_128" id="FNanchor_128_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> it affords a brilliant proof of the plentitude
of the gospels among them; for no less than
twenty-five copies are described. We may judge
to what height the art of bookbinding had arrived
by the account here given of these precious volumes.
Some were in a splendid coopertoria of gold and
silver, and others exquisitely ornamented with
figures of our Saviour and the four Evangelists.<a name="FNanchor_129_129" id="FNanchor_129_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
But this extravagant costliness rendered them attractive
objects to pilfering hands, and somewhat
accounts for the lament of the industrious Somner,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86"></a>[<a href="./images/86.png">86</a>]</span>
who says that the library was "shamefully robbed
and spoiled of them all."<a name="FNanchor_130_130" id="FNanchor_130_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a></p>

<p>Our remarks on the monastic library at Canterbury
are drawing to a close. Henry <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'Chicleley'">Chiclely</ins>,
archbishop in 1413, an excellent man, and a great
promoter of learning, rebuilt the library of the
church, and furnished it with many a choice tome.<a name="FNanchor_131_131" id="FNanchor_131_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a>
His esteem for literature was so great, that he built
two colleges at Oxford.<a name="FNanchor_132_132" id="FNanchor_132_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> William Sellinge, who
was a man of erudition, and deeply imbued with
the book-loving mania, was elected prior in 1472.
He is said to have studied at Bonania, in Italy;
and, during his travels, he gathered together "all
the ancient authors, both Greek and Latine, he
could get," and returned laden with them to his own
country. Many of them were of great rarity, and
it is said that a Tully <i>de Republica</i> was among
them. Unfortunately, they were all burnt by a
fire in the monastery.<a name="FNanchor_133_133" id="FNanchor_133_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>I have said enough, I think, to show that books
were eagerly sought after, and deeply appreciated,
in Canterbury cloisters during the middle ages, and
when the reader considers that these facts have
been preserved from sheer accident, and, therefore,
only enable us to obtain a partial glimpse of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87"></a>[<a href="./images/87.png">87</a>]</span>
actual state of their library, he will be ready to
admit that bibliomania existed then, and will feel
thankful, too, that it did, for to its influence, surely,
we are indebted for the preservation of much that
is valuable and instructive in history and general
literature.<a name="FNanchor_134_134" id="FNanchor_134_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p>We can scarcely leave Kent without a word or
two respecting the church of the Rochester monks.
It was founded by King Ethelbert, who conferred
upon it the dignities of an episcopal see, in the
year 600; and, dedicating it to St. Andrew, completed
the good work by many donations and
emoluments. The revenues of the see were always
limited, and it is said that its poverty caused it to
be treated with kind forbearance by the ecclesiastical
commissioners at the period of the Reformation.</p>

<p>I have not been able to meet with any catalogue
of its monastic library, and the only hints I
can obtain relative to their books are such as may
be gathered from the recorded donations of its
learned prelates and monks. In the year 1077,
Gundulph, a Norman bishop, who is justly celebrated
for his architectural talents, rebuilt the
cathedral, and considerable remains of this structure
are still to be seen in the nave and west front,
and display that profuse decoration united with
ponderous stability, for which the Norman buildings
are so remarkable. This munificent prelate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88"></a>[<a href="./images/88.png">88</a>]</span>
also enriched the church with numerous and costly
ornaments; the encouragement he gave to learning
calls for some notice here. Trained in one of the
most flourishing of the Norman schools, we are not
surprised that in his early youth he was so studious
and inquisitive after knowledge as to merit the
especial commendation of his biographer.<a name="FNanchor_135_135" id="FNanchor_135_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> William
of Malmsbury, too, highly extols him "for his
abundant piety," and tells us that he was not inexperienced
in literary avocations; he was polished
and courageous in the management of judicial
affairs, and a close, devoted student of the divine
writings;<a name="FNanchor_136_136" id="FNanchor_136_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> as a scribe he was industrious and critical,
and the great purpose to which he applied his
patience and erudition was a careful revisal of the
Holy Scriptures. He purged the sacred volume of
the inadvertencies of the scribes, and restored the
purity of the text; for transcribing after transcribing
had caused some errors and diversity of readings
to occur, between the English and foreign
codices, in spite of all the pious care of the monastic
copyists; this was perplexing, an uniformity was
essential and he undertook the task;<a name="FNanchor_137_137" id="FNanchor_137_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a> labors so
valuable deserve the highest praise, and we bestow
it more liberally upon him for this good work than
we should have done had he been the compiler of
crude homilies or the marvellous legends of saints.
The high veneration in which Gundulph held the
patristic writings induced him to bestow his attention
in a similar manner upon them, he compared<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89"></a>[<a href="./images/89.png">89</a>]</span>
copies, studied their various readings and set to
work to correct them. The books necessary for
these critical researches he obtained from the
libraries of his former master, Bishop Lanfranc,
St. Anselm, his schoolfellow, and many others who
were studying at Bec, but besides this, he corrected
many other authors, and by comparing them with
ancient manuscripts, restored them to their primitive
beauty. Fabricius<a name="FNanchor_138_138" id="FNanchor_138_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> notices a fine volume, which
bore ample testimony to his critical erudition and
dexterity as a scribe. It is described as a large
Bible on parchment, written in most beautiful
characters, it was proved to be his work by this
inscription on its title page, "<i>Prima pars Bibli&aelig;
per bona memori&aelig; Gundulphum Rossensem Episcopum</i>."
This interesting manuscript, formerly in
the library of the monks of Rochester, was regarded
as one of their most precious volumes. An
idea of the great value of a Bible in those times
may be derived from the curious fact that the bishop
made a decree directing "excommunication to be
pronounced against whosoever should take away or
conceal this volume, or who should even dare to
conceal the inscription on the front, which indicated
the volume to be the property of the church of
Rochester." But we must bear in mind that this was
no ordinary copy, it was transcribed by Gundulph's
own pen, and rendered pure in its text by his
critical labors. But the time came when anathemas
availed nought, and excommunication was divested
of all terror. "Henry the Eighth," the "Defender
of the Faith," frowned destruction upon the monks,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90"></a>[<a href="./images/90.png">90</a>]</span>
and in the tumult that ensued, this treasure was
carried away, anathema and all. Somehow or
other it got to Amsterdam, perhaps sent over in
one of those "shippes full," to the bookbinders,
and having passed through many hands, at last
found its way into the possession of Herman Van
de Wal, Burgomaster of Amsterdam; since then it
was sold by public auction, but has now I believe
been lost sight of.<a name="FNanchor_139_139" id="FNanchor_139_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> Among the numerous
treasures which Gundulph gave to his church, he
included a copy of the Gospels, two missals and a
book of Epistles.<a name="FNanchor_140_140" id="FNanchor_140_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Similar books were given by
succeeding prelates; Radolphus, a Norman bishop
in 1108, gave the monks several copies of the gospels
beautifully adorned.<a name="FNanchor_141_141" id="FNanchor_141_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> Earnulphus, in the year
1115, was likewise a benefactor in this way; he
bestowed upon them, besides many gold and silver
utensils for the church, a copy of the gospels,
lessons for the principal days, a benedictional, or
book of blessings, a missal, handsomely bound, and
a capitular.<a name="FNanchor_142_142" id="FNanchor_142_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> Ascelin, formerly prior of Dover,
and made bishop of Rochester, in the year 1142,
gave them a Psalter and the Epistles of St. Paul,
with a gloss.<a name="FNanchor_143_143" id="FNanchor_143_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> He was a learned man, and excessively
fond of books; a passion which he had
acquired no doubt in his monastery of Dover which
possessed a library of no mean extent.<a name="FNanchor_144_144" id="FNanchor_144_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> He<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91"></a>[<a href="./images/91.png">91</a>]</span>
wrote a commentary on Isaiah, and gave it to the
monastery; Walter, archdeacon of Canterbury,
who succeeded Ascelin, gave a copy of the gospels
bound in gold, to the church;<a name="FNanchor_145_145" id="FNanchor_145_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and Waleran,
elected bishop in the year 1182, presented them
with a glossed Psalter, the Epistles of Paul, and
the Sermons of Peter.<a name="FNanchor_146_146" id="FNanchor_146_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Glanvill, bishop in the year 1184, endeavored
to deprive the monks of the land which Gundulph
had bestowed upon them; this gave to rise to many
quarrels<a name="FNanchor_147_147" id="FNanchor_147_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_147_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> which the monks never forgave; it is
said that he died without regret, and was buried
without ceremony; yet the curious may still inspect
his tomb on the north side of the altar, with
his effigies and mitre lying at length upon it.<a name="FNanchor_148_148" id="FNanchor_148_148"></a><a href="#Footnote_148_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
Glanvill probably repented of his conduct, and he
strove to banish all animosity by many donations;
and among other treasures, he gave the monks the
five books of Moses and other volumes.<a name="FNanchor_149_149" id="FNanchor_149_149"></a><a href="#Footnote_149_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">he</span> Benedictine monastery of Lindesfarne,
or the Holy Island, as
it was called, was founded through
the instrumentality of Oswald, the
son of Ethelfrith, king of Northumberland,
who was anxious for
the promulgation of the Christian faith within
his dominions. Aidan, the first bishop of whom
we have any distinct account, was appointed about
the year 635. Bede tells us that he used frequently
to retire to the Isle of Farne, that he
might pray in private and be undisturbed.<a name="FNanchor_153_153" id="FNanchor_153_153"></a><a href="#Footnote_153_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a> This
small island, distant about nine miles from the
church of Lindesfarne, obtained great celebrity<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94"></a>[<a href="./images/94.png">94</a>]</span>
from St. Cuthbert, who sought that quiet spot and
led there a lonely existence in great continence
of mind and body.<a name="FNanchor_154_154" id="FNanchor_154_154"></a><a href="#Footnote_154_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> In 685 he was appointed to the
see of Lindesfarne, where, by his pious example
and regular life, he instructed many in their religious
duties. The name of this illustrious saint is
intimately connected with a most magnificent specimen
of calligraphical art of the eighth century,
preserved in the British Museum,<a name="FNanchor_155_155" id="FNanchor_155_155"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> and well known
by the name of the Durham Book, or Saint
Cuthbert's Gospels; it was written some years after
the death of that Saint, in honor of his memory,
by Egfrith, a monk of Lindesfarne, who was made
bishop of that see in the year 698. At Egfrith's
death in 721, his successor, &AElig;thilwald, most beautifully
bound it in gold and precious stones, and
Bilfrid, a hermit, richly illuminated it by prefixing
to each gospel a beautiful painting representing
one of the Evangelists, and a tesselated cross,
executed in a most elaborate manner. He also
displayed great skill by illuminating the large capital
letters at the commencement of each gospel.<a name="FNanchor_156_156" id="FNanchor_156_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
Doubtless, the hermit Bilfrid was an eminent
artist in his day. Aldred, the Glossator, a priest
of Durham, about the year 950, still more enriched
this precious volume by interlining it with a Saxon
Gloss, or version of the Latin text of St. Jerome,
of which the original manuscript is a copy.<a name="FNanchor_157_157" id="FNanchor_157_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95"></a>[<a href="./images/95.png">95</a>]</span>
therefore, one of the most venerable of those early
attempts to render the holy scriptures into the
vernacular tongue, and is on that account an interesting
relic to the Christian reader, and, no doubt,
formed the choicest volume in the library of
Lindesfarne.<a name="FNanchor_158_158" id="FNanchor_158_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a></p></div>

<p>But imperfectly, indeed, have I described the
splendid manuscript which is now lying, in all its
charms, before me. And as I mark its fine old
illuminations, so bright in color, and so chaste in
execution, the accuracy of its transcription, and
the uniform beauty of its calligraphy, my imagination
carries me back to the quiet cloister of
the old Saxon scribe who wrote it, and I can
see in Egfrith, a bibliomaniac, of no mean pretensions,
and in Bilfrid, a monkish illuminator,
well initiated in the mysteries of his art. The
manuscript contains 258 double columned folio
pages, and the paintings of the Evangelists each
occupy an entire page. We learn the history
of its production from a very long note at the
end of the manuscript, written by the hand of the
glossator.<a name="FNanchor_159_159" id="FNanchor_159_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>But sad misfortunes were in store for the holy
monks, for about 793, or a little earlier, when
Highbald was abbot, the Danes burnt down the
monastery and murdered the ecclesiastics; "most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96"></a>[<a href="./images/96.png">96</a>]</span>
dreadful lightnings and other prodigies," says
Simeon of Durham, "are said to have portended
the impending ruin of this place; on the 7th of
June they came to the church of Lindesfarne,
miserably plundered all places, overthrew the
altars, and carried away all the treasures of the
church, some of the monks they slew, some they carried
away captives, some they drowned in the sea,
and others much afflicted and abused they turned
away naked."<a name="FNanchor_160_160" id="FNanchor_160_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Fortunately some of the poor
monks escaped, and after a short time returned
to their old spot, and with religious zeal set about
repairing the damage which the sacred edifice had
sustained; after its restoration they continued comparatively
quiet till the time of Eardulfus, when
the Danes in the year 875, again invaded England
and burned down the monastery of Lindesfarne.
The monks obtained some knowledge of their
coming and managed to effect their escape, taking
with them the body of St. Cuthbert, which they
highly venerated, with many other honored relics;
they then set out with the bishop Eardulfus and
the abbot Eadrid at their head on a sort of pilgrimage
to discover some suitable resting place
for the remains of their saint; but finding no safe
locality, and becoming fatigued by the irksomeness
of the journey, they as a last resource resolved
to pass over to Ireland. For this purpose they
proceeded to the sea, but no sooner were they on
board the ship than a terrific storm arose, and had
it not been for the fond care of their patron saint,
a watery grave would have been forever their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97"></a>[<a href="./images/97.png">97</a>]</span>
resting place; but, as it was, their lives were spared,
and the holy bones preserved to bless mankind,
and work wondrous miracles in the old church
of the Saxon monks. Nevertheless, considerable
damage was sustained, and the fury of the angry
waves forced them back again to the shore. The
monks deeming this an indication of God's will
that they should remain, decided upon doing so,
and leaving the ship, they agreed to proceed on
their way rejoicing, and place still greater trust
in the mercy of God and the miraculous influence
of St. Cuthbert's holy bones; but some whose
reliance on Divine providence appears not so conspicuous,
became dissatisfied, and separated from
the rest till at last only seven monks were left
besides their bishop and abbot. Their relics were
too numerous and too cumbersome to be conveyed
by so small a number, and they knew not how to
proceed; but one of the seven whose name was
Hanred had a vision, wherein he was told that
they should repair to the sea, where they would
find a book of Gospels adorned with gold and
precious stones, which had been lost out of the
ship when they were in the storm; and that after
that he should see a bridle hanging on a tree,
which he should take down and put upon a horse
that would come to him, which horse he should
put to a cart he would also find, to carry the holy
body, which would be an ease to them. All these
things happening accordingly, they travelled with
more comfort, following the horse, which way
soever he should lead. The book above mentioned
was no ways damaged by the water, and is still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98"></a>[<a href="./images/98.png">98</a>]</span>
preserved in the library at Durham,<a name="FNanchor_161_161" id="FNanchor_161_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> where it
remained till the Reformation, when it was stript
of its jewelled covering, and after passing through
many hands, ultimately came into the possession
of Sir Robert Cotton, in whose collection, as we
have said before, it is now preserved in the British
Museum.</p>

<p>I cannot refrain, even at the risk of incurring
some blame for my digression, presenting the
reader with a part of a letter full of fraternal love,
which Alcuin addressed to the monks of Lindesfarne
on this sad occasion.</p>

<p>"Your dearest fraternity," says he, "was wont
to afford me much joy. But now how different!
though absent, I deeply lament the more your
tribulations and calamities; the manner in which
the Pagans contaminate the sanctuaries of God,
and shed the blood of saints around the altar,
devastating the joy of our house, and trampling on
the bodies of holy men in the temple of God, as
though they were treading on a dunghill in the
street. But of what effect is our wailing unless we
come before the altars of Christ and cry, 'Spare
me, O Lord! spare thy people, and take not thine
inheritance from them;' nor let the Pagans say,
'Where is the God of the Christians?' Besides
who is to pacify the churches of Britain, if
St. Cuthbert cannot defend them with so great a
number of saints? Nevertheless do not trouble
the mind about these things, for God chasteneth
all the sons whom he receiveth, and therefore
perhaps afflicts you the more, because he the more<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99"></a>[<a href="./images/99.png">99</a>]</span>
loveth you. Jerusalem, the delightful city of God,
was lost by the Chaldean scourge; and Rome, the
city of the holy Apostles and innumerable martyrs,
was surrounded by the Pagans and devastated.
Well nigh the whole of Europe is evacuated by
the scourging sword of the Goths or the Huns.
But in the same manner in which God preserved
the stars to illuminate the heavens, so will He
preserve the churches to ornament, and in their
office to strengthen and increase the Christian
religion."<a name="FNanchor_162_162" id="FNanchor_162_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_162_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a></p>

<p>Thus it came to pass that Eardulphus was the
last bishop of Lindesfarne and the first of Cunecacestre,
or Chester-upon-the-Street, to which place
his see was removed previous to its final settlement
at Durham.</p>

<p>After a succession of many bishops, some recorded
as learned and bookish by monkish annalists,
and nearly all benefactors in some way to
their church, we arrive at the period when Aldwine
was consecrated bishop of that see in the year
990. The commotions of his time made his presidency
a troubled and harassing one. Sweyn, king
of Denmark, and Olauis, king of Norway, invaded
England, and spreading themselves in bodies over
the kingdom, committed many and cruel depredations;
a strong body of these infested the
northern coast, and approached the vicinity of
Chester-on-the-Street. This so alarmed Aldwine,
that he resolved to quit his church&mdash;for the great
riches and numerous relics of that holy place were
attractive objects to the plundering propensities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100"></a>[<a href="./images/100.png">100</a>]</span>
the invaders. Carrying, therefore, the bones of
St. Cuthbert with them&mdash;for that box of mortal
dust was ever precious in the sight of those old
monks&mdash;and the costly treasures of the church, not
forgetting their books, the monks fled to Ripon,
and the see, which after similar adversities their
predecessors one hundred and thirteen years ago
had settled at Chester, was forever removed. It
is true three or four months after, as Symeon of
Durham tells us, they attempted to return, but
when they reached a place called Werdelan, "on
the east and near unto Durham," they could not
move the bier on which the body of St. Cuthbert
was carried, although they applied their united
strength to effect it. The superstition, or perhaps
simplicity, of the monks instantly interpreted this
into a manifestation of divine interference, and
they resolved not to return again to their old spot.
And we are further told that after three days'
fasting and prayer, the Lord vouchsafed to reveal
to them that they should bear the saintly burden
to Durham, a command which they piously and
cheerfully obeyed. Having arrived there, they
fixed on a wild and uncultivated site, and making
a simple oratory of wattles for the temporary reception
of their relics, they set zealously to work&mdash;for
these old monks well knew what labor was&mdash;to
cut down wood, to clear the ground, and build an
habitation for themselves. Shortly after, in the
wilderness of that neglected spot, the worthy
bishop Aldwine erected a goodly church of stone
to the honor of God, and as a humble tribute of
gratitude and love; and so it was that Aldwine,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101"></a>[<a href="./images/101.png">101</a>]</span>
the last bishop of Chester-on-the-Street, was the
first of Durham.</p>

<p>When William Carelepho, a Norman monk,
was consecrated bishop, the church had so increased
in wealth and usefulness, that fresh wants
arose, more space was requisite, and a grander
structure would be preferable; the bishop thereupon
pulled the old church of Aldwine down and
commenced the erection of a more magnificent one
in its place, as the beauty of Durham cathedral
sufficiently testifies even now; and will not the
lover of artistic beauty award his praise to the
Norman bishop&mdash;those massive columns and stupendous
arches excite the admiring wonder of all;
built on a rocky eminence and surrounded by all
the charms of a romantic scenery, it is one of the
finest specimens of architecture which the enthusiasm
of monkish days dedicated to piety and to
God. Its liberal founder however did not live to
see it finished, for he died in the year 1095, two
years after laying its foundation stone. His bookloving
propensities have been honorably recorded,
and not only was he fond of reading, but kept the
pens of the scribes in constant motion, and used
himself to superintend the transcription of manuscripts,
as the colophon of a folio volume in Durham
library fully proves.<a name="FNanchor_163_163" id="FNanchor_163_163"></a><a href="#Footnote_163_163" class="fnanchor">[163]</a> The monkish bibliophiles
of his church received from him a precious
gift of about 40 volumes, containing among other
valuable books Prosper, Pompeii, Tertullian, and a
great Bible in two volumes.<a name="FNanchor_164_164" id="FNanchor_164_164"></a><a href="#Footnote_164_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102"></a>[<a href="./images/102.png">102</a>]</span></p><p>It would have been difficult perhaps to have
found in those days a body of monks so "bookish"
as those of Durham; not only did they transcribe
with astonishing rapidity, proving that there was
no want of vellum there, but they must have
bought or otherwise collected a great number of
books; for the see of Durham, in the early part of
the 12th century, could show a library embracing
nearly 300 volumes.<a name="FNanchor_165_165" id="FNanchor_165_165"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p>Nor let the reader imagine that the collection
possessed no merit in a literary point of view, or
that the monks cared for little else save legends of
saints or the literature of the church; the catalogue
proves them to have enjoyed a more liberal and a
more refined taste, and again display the cloistered
students of the middle ages as the preservers of
classic learning. This is a point worth observing
on looking over the old parchment catalogues of
the monks; for as by their Epistles we obtain a
knowledge of their intimacy with the old writers,
and the use they made of them, so by their catalogues
we catch a glimpse of the means they possessed
of becoming personally acquainted with
their beauties; by the process much light may be
thrown on the gloom of those long past times, and
perhaps we shall gain too a better view of the state
of learning existing then. But that the reader
may judge for himself, I extract the names of some
of the writers whom the monks of Durham preserved
and read:</p>

is the next who attracts our attention by his bibliomanical
renown. He possessed perhaps the finest
copy of the Holy Scriptures of any private collector;
and he doubtless regarded his "<i>unam Bibliam in</i>
iv. <i>magnis voluminibus</i>," with the veneration of a
divine and the fondness of a student. He collected
what in those times was deemed a respectable
library, and bequeathed no less than sixty or
seventy volumes to the Durham monks, including
his great Bible, which has ever since been preserved
with religious care; from a catalogue of them we
learn his partiality for classical literature; a Tully,
Sedulus, Priscian, and Claudius, are mentioned
among them.<a name="FNanchor_167_167" id="FNanchor_167_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_167" class="fnanchor">[167]</a></p>

the year 1283, was a most ambitious and haughty
prelate, and caused great dissensions in his church.
History proves how little he was adapted for the
responsible duties of a bishop, and points to the
field of battle or civil pomp as most congenial to
his disposition. He ostentatiously displayed the
splendor of a Palatine Prince, when he contributed
his powerful aid to the cause of his sovereign, in
the Scottish war, by a retinue of 500 horse, 1000
foot, 140 knights, and 26 standard bearers,<a name="FNanchor_168_168" id="FNanchor_168_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_168" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> rendered
doubly imposing in those days of saintly
worship and credulity, by the patronage of St.
Cuthbert, under whole holy banner they marched
against a brave and noble foe. His arbitrary
temper caused sad quarrels in the cloister, which
ultimately gave rise to a tedious law proceeding
between him and the prior about the year 1300;<a name="FNanchor_169_169" id="FNanchor_169_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_169" class="fnanchor">[169]</a>
from a record of this affair we learn that the bishop
had borrowed some books from the library which
afterwards he refused to return; there was among
them a Decretal, a history of England, a Missal,
and a volume called "The book of St. Cuthbert,
in which the secrets of the monastery are written,"
which was alone valued at &pound;200,<a name="FNanchor_170_170" id="FNanchor_170_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_170" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> probably in consideration
of the important and delicate matters
contained therein.</p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105"></a>[<a href="./images/105.png">105</a>]</span></p><p>These proceedings were instituted by prior
Hoton, who was fond of books, and had a great
esteem for learning; he founded a college at Oxford
for the monkish students of his church.<a name="FNanchor_171_171" id="FNanchor_171_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_171" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> On
more than one occasion he sent parcels of books
to Oxford; in a list of an early date it appears that
the monks of Durham sent at one time twenty
volumes, and shortly after fifteen more, consisting
principally of church books and lives of saints.<a name="FNanchor_172_172" id="FNanchor_172_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_172" class="fnanchor">[172]</a>
The numbers thus taken from their library the
monks, with that love of learning for which they
were so remarkable, anxiously replaced, by purchasing
about twenty volumes, many of which contained
a great number of small but choice pieces.<a name="FNanchor_173_173" id="FNanchor_173_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_173" class="fnanchor">[173]</a></p>

<p>Robert de Graystane, a monk of Durham, was
elected bishop by the prior and chapter, and confirmed
on the 10th of November, 1333, but the
king, Edward III., wishing to advance his treasurer
to that see, refused his sanction to the proceeding;
monk Robert was accordingly deposed, and
Richard Angraville received the mitre in his stead.
He was consecrated on the 19th of December in
the same year, by John Stratford, archbishop of
Canterbury, and installed by proxy on the 10th of
January, 1334.</p>

<p>Angraville, Aungerville, or as he is more commonly
called Richard de Bury, is a name which
every bibliophile will honor and esteem; he was
indeed a bibliomaniac of the first order, and a
sketch of his life is not only indispensable here,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106"></a>[<a href="./images/106.png">106</a>]</span>
but cannot fail to interest the book-loving reader.
But before entering more at large into his bookish
propensities and talents, it will be necessary to say
something of his early days and the illustrious
career which attended his political and ecclesiastical
life. Richard de Bury, the son of Sir Richard
Angraville, was born, as his name implies, at Bury
St. Edmunds, in Suffolk, in the year 1287.<a name="FNanchor_174_174" id="FNanchor_174_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_174" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>Great attention was paid to the instruction of
his youthful mind by his maternal uncle, John de
Willowby, a priest, previous to his removal to Oxford.
At the university he obtained honorable
distinction, as much for his erudition and love of
books as for the moral rectitude of his behavior.
These pleasing traits were the stepping stones to
his future greatness, and on the strength of them
he was selected as one fully competent to undertake
the education of Edward Prince of Wales,
afterwards the third king of that name; and to
Richard de Bury "may be traced the love for literature
and the arts displayed by his pupil when on
the throne. He was rewarded with the lucrative
appointment of treasurer of Gascony."<a name="FNanchor_175_175" id="FNanchor_175_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_175" class="fnanchor">[175]</a></p>

<p>When Edward, the prince of Wales, was sent
to Paris to assume the dominion of Guienne, which
the king had resigned in his favor, he was accompanied
by queen Isabella, his mother, whose criminal
frailty, and afterwards conspiracy, with Mortimer,
aroused the just indignation of her royal husband;
and commenced those civil dissensions which ren<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107"></a>[<a href="./images/107.png">107</a>]</span>dered
the reign of Edward II. so disastrous and
turbulent. It was during these commotions that
Richard de Bury became a zealous partizan of the
queen, to whom he fled, and ventured to supply
her pecuniary necessities from the royal revenues;
for this, however, he was surrounded with imminent
danger; for the king, instituting an inquiry into
these proceedings, attempted his capture, which he
narrowly escaped by secreting himself in the belfry
of the convent of Brothers Minor at Paris.<a name="FNanchor_176_176" id="FNanchor_176_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_176" class="fnanchor">[176]</a></p>

<p>When the "most invincible and most magnificent
king" Edward III. was firmly seated upon the
throne, dignity and power was lavishly bestowed
on this early bibliomaniac. In an almost incredible
space of time he was appointed cofferer to the
king, treasurer of the wardrobe, archdeacon of
Northampton, prebendary of Lincoln, Sarum, Litchfield,
and shortly afterwards keeper of the privy
seal, which office he held for five years. During
this time he twice undertook a visit to Italy, on a
mission to the supreme pontiff, John XXII., who
not only entertained him with honor and distinction,
but appointed him chaplain to his principal
chapel, and gave him a bull, nominating him to the
first vacant see in England.</p>

<p>He acquired whilst there an honor which reflected
more credit than even the smiles of his holiness&mdash;the
brightest of the Italian poets, Petrarch
of never dying fame&mdash;bestowed upon him his
acquaintance and lasting friendship. De Bury
entered Avignon for the first time in the same<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108"></a>[<a href="./images/108.png">108</a>]</span>
year that Petrarch took up his residence there, in
the house of Colonna, bishop of Lombes: two such
enlightened scholars and indefatigable book collectors,
sojourning in the same city, soon formed
an intimacy.<a name="FNanchor_177_177" id="FNanchor_177_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_177" class="fnanchor">[177]</a> How interesting must their friendly
meetings have been, and how delightful the hours
spent in Petrarch's library, which was one of great
extent and rarity; and it is probable too that De
Bury obtained from the poet a few treasures to
enrich his own stores; for the generosity of Petrarch
was so excessive, that he could scarcely withhold
what he knew was so dearly coveted. His benevolence
on one occasion deprived him and posterity
of an inestimable volume; he lent some manuscripts
of the classics to his old master, who, needing
pecuniary aid, pawned them, and Cicero's books,
<i>De Gloria</i>, were in this manner irrecoverably lost.<a name="FNanchor_178_178" id="FNanchor_178_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_178_178" class="fnanchor">[178]</a>
Petrarch acted like a true lover of learning; for
when the shadows of old age approached, he
presented his library, full of rare and ancient
manuscripts, many of them enriched by his own
notes, to the Venetian Senate, and thus laid the
foundation of the library of Saint-Marc; he always
employed a number of transcribers, who invariably
accompanied him on his journeys, and he kept
horses to carry his books.<a name="FNanchor_179_179" id="FNanchor_179_179"></a><a href="#Footnote_179_179" class="fnanchor">[179]</a> His love of reading
was intense. "Whether," he writes in one of his
epistles, "I am being shaved, or having my hair
cut, whether I am riding on horseback or taking
my meals, I either read myself or get some one to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109"></a>[<a href="./images/109.png">109</a>]</span>
read to me; on the table where I dine, and by the
side of my bed, I have all the materials for writing.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_180_180" id="FNanchor_180_180"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_180" class="fnanchor">[180]</a>
With the friendship of such a student, how charming
must have been the visit of the English ambassador,
and how much valuable and interesting
information must he have gleaned by his intercourse
with Petrarch and his books. At Rome
Richard de Bury obtained many choice volumes
and rare old manuscripts of the classics; for at
Rome indeed, at that time, books had become an
important article of commerce, and many foreign
collectors besides the English bibliomaniac resorted
there for these treasures: to such an extend was
this carried on, that the jealousy of Petrarch was
aroused, who, in addressing the Romans, exclaims:
"Are you not ashamed that the wrecks of your
ancient grandeur, spared by the inundation of the
barbarians, are daily sold by your miscalculating
avarice to foreigners? And that Rome is no where
less known and less loved than at Rome?"<a name="FNanchor_181_181" id="FNanchor_181_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_181" class="fnanchor">[181]</a></p>

<p>The immense ecclesiastical and civil revenues
which Aungraville enjoyed, enabled him whilst in
Italy to maintain a most costly and sumptuous
establishment: in his last visit alone he is said to
have expended 5,000 marks, and he never appeared
in public without a numerous retinue of twenty
clerks and thirty-six esquires; an appearance which
better became the dignity of his civil office, than
the Christian humility of his ecclesiastical functions.
On his return from this distinguished sojourn,
he was appointed, as we have said before,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110"></a>[<a href="./images/110.png">110</a>]</span>
through the instrumentality of Edward III., to the
bishopric of Durham. But not content with these
high preferments, his royal master advanced him to
still greater honor, and on the 28th of September,
1334, he was made Lord Chancellor of England,
which office he filled till the 5th of June, 1335, when
he exchanged it for that of high treasurer. He
was twice appointed ambassador to the king of
France, respecting the claims of Edward of England
to the crown of that country. De Bury,
whilst negociating this affair, visited Antwerp and
Brabant for the furtherance of the object of his
mission, and he fully embraced this rare opportunity
of adding to his literary stores, and returned
to his fatherland well laden with many choice and
costly manuscripts; for in all his perilous missions
he carried about with him, as he tells us, that love
of books which many waters could not extinguish,
but which greatly sweetened the bitterness of
peregrination. Whilst at Paris he was especially
assiduous in collecting, and he relates with intense
rapture, how many choice libraries he found there
full of all kinds of books, which tempted him to
spend his money freely; and with a gladsome heart
he gave his dirty lucre for treasures so inestimable
to the bibliomaniac.</p>

<p>Before the commencement of the war which
arose from the disputed claims of Edward, Richard
de Bury returned to enjoy in sweet seclusion his
bibliomanical propensities. The modern bibliophiles
who know what it is to revel in the enjoyment
of a goodly library, luxuriant in costly bindings
and rich in bibliographical rarities, who are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111"></a>[<a href="./images/111.png">111</a>]</span>
fully susceptible to the delights and exquisite sensibilities
of that sweet madness called bibliomania,
will readily comprehend the multiplied pleasures
of that early and illustrious bibliophile in the seclusion
of Auckland Palace; he there ardently applied
his energies and wealth to the accumulation of
books; and whilst engaged in this pleasing avocation,
let us endeavor to catch a glimpse of him.
Chambre, to whom we are indebted for many of
the above particulars, tells us that Richard de Bury
was learned in the governing of his house, hospitable
to strangers, of great charity, and fond of
disputation with the learned, but he principally
delighted in a multitude of books, <i>Iste summe delectabatur
multitudine librorum</i>,<a name="FNanchor_182_182" id="FNanchor_182_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_182" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> and possessed more
books than all the bishops put together, an assertion
which requires some modification, and must
not be too strictly regarded, for book collecting at
that time was becoming a favorite pursuit; still the
language of Chambre is expressive, and clearly
proves how extensive must have been his libraries,
one of which he formed in each of his various
palaces, <i>diversis maneriis</i>. So engrossed was that
worthy bishop with the passion of book collecting,
that his dormitory was strewed <i>jucebant</i> with them,
in every nook and corner choice volumes were
scattered, so that it was almost impossible for any
person to enter without placing his feet upon some
book.<a name="FNanchor_183_183" id="FNanchor_183_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_183" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> He kept in regular employment no small
assemblage of antiquaries, scribes, bookbinders,
correctors, illuminators, and all such persons who<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112"></a>[<a href="./images/112.png">112</a>]</span>
were capable of being useful in the service of
books, <i>librorum servitiis utiliter</i>.<a name="FNanchor_184_184" id="FNanchor_184_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_184" class="fnanchor">[184]</a></p>

<p>During his retirement he wrote a book, from
the perusal of which the bibliomaniac will obtain a
full measure of delight and instruction. It is a faithful
record of the life and experience of this bibliophile
of the olden time. He tells us how he collected
his vellum treasures&mdash;his "crackling tomes"
so rich in illuminations and calligraphic art!&mdash;how
he preserved them, and how he would have others
read them. Costly indeed must have been the
book gems he amassed together; for foreign countries,
as well as the scribes at home, yielded ample
means to augment his stores, and were incessantly
employed in searching for rarities which his heart
yearned to possess. He completed his Philobiblon
at his palace at Auckland on the 24th of January,
1344.<a name="FNanchor_185_185" id="FNanchor_185_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_185" class="fnanchor">[185]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113"></a>[<a href="./images/113.png">113</a>]</span></p>
<p>We learn from the prologue to this rare and
charming little volume how true and genuine a
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'biblomaniac'">bibliomaniac</ins> was Richard de Bury, for he tells us
there, that a vehement love <i>amor excitet</i> of books
had so powerfully seized all the faculties of his
mind, that dismissing all other avocations, he had
applied the ardor of his thoughts to the acquisition
of books. Expense to him was quite an afterthought,
and he begrudged no amount to possess
a volume of rarity or antiquity. Wisdom, he says,
is an infinite treasure <i>infinitus thesaurus</i>, the value
of which, in his opinion, was beyond all things; for
how, he asks, can the sum be too great which purchases
such vast delight. We cannot admire the
purity of his Latin so much as the enthusiasm
which pervades it; but in the eyes of the bibliophile
this will amply compensate for his minor imperfections.
When expatiating on the value of his
books he appears to unbosom, as it were, all the
inward rapture of love. A very <i>helluo librorum</i>&mdash;a
very Maliabechi of a collector, yet he encouraged
no selfish feeling to alloy his pleasure or to mingle
bitterness with the sweets of his avocation. His
knowledge he freely imparted to others, and his
books he gladly lent. This is apparent in the
Philobiblon; and his generous spirit warms his diction&mdash;not
always chaste&mdash;into a fluent eloquence.
His composition overflows with figurative expressions,
yet the rude, ungainly form on which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114"></a>[<a href="./images/114.png">114</a>]</span>
are moulded deprive them of all claim to elegance
or chastity; but while the homeliness of his diction
fails to impress us with an idea of his versatility as
a writer, his chatty anecdotal style rivets and keeps
the mind amused, so that we rise from the little
book with the consciousness of having obtained
much profit and satisfaction from its perusal. Nor
is it only the bibliomaniac who may hope to taste
this pleasure in devouring the sweet contents of
the Philobiblon; for there are many hints, many
wise sayings, and many singular ideas scattered
over its pages, which will amuse or instruct the
general reader and the lover of olden literature.
We observe too that Richard de Bury, as a
writer, was far in advance of his age, and his work
manifests an unusual freedom and independence
of mind in its author; for although living in
monkish days, when the ecclesiastics were almost
supreme in power and wealth, he was fully sensible
of the vile corruptions and abominations
which were spreading about that time so fearfully
among some of the cloistered devotees&mdash;the spotless
purity of the primitive times was scarce known
then&mdash;and the dark periods of the middle ages were
bright and holy, when compared with the looseness
and carnality of those turbulent days. Richard de
Bury dipped his pen in gall when he spoke of these
sad things, and doubtless many a revelling monk
winced under the lashing words he applied to them;
not only does he upbraid them for their carelessness
in religion, but severely reprimands their inattention
to literature and learning. "The monks," he
says, "in the present day seem to be occupied in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115"></a>[<a href="./images/115.png">115</a>]</span>
emptying cups, not in correcting codices, <i>Calicibus
epotandis, non codicibus emendandis</i>, which they
mingle with the lascivious music of Timotheus, and
emulate his immodest manners, so that the sportive
song <i>cantus ludentis</i>, and not the plaintive hymn,
proceeds from the cells of the monks. Flocks and
fleeces, grain and granaries, gardens and olives,
potions and goblets, are in this day lessons and
studies of the monks, except some chosen few.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_186_186" id="FNanchor_186_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_186" class="fnanchor">[186]</a> He
speaks in equally harsh terms of the religious mendicants.
He accuses them of forgetting the words
and admonitions of their holy founder, who was a
great lover of books. He wishes them to imitate the
ancient members of that fraternity, who were poor
in spirit, but most rich in faith. But it must be remembered,
that about this time the mendicant friars
were treated with undeserved contempt, and much
ill feeling rose against them among the clergy, but
the clergy were somewhat prejudiced in their judgment.
The order of St. Dominic, which a century
before gloried in the approbation of the pope, and
in the enjoyment of his potential bulls, now winced
under gloomy and foreboding frowns. The sovereign
Pontiff Honorius III. gratefully embraced the
service of these friars, and confirmed their order
with important privileges. His successor, Gregory
IX., ratified these favors to gain their useful aid in
propping up the papal power, and commanded the
ecclesiastics by a bull to receive these "well-beloved
children and preaching friars" of his, with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116"></a>[<a href="./images/116.png">116</a>]</span>
hospitality and respect. Thus established, they
were able to bear the tossings to and fro which succeeding
years produced; but in Richard de Bury's
time darker clouds were gathering&mdash;great men had
severely chastized them with their pens and denounced
them in their preachings. Soon after a
host of others sprang up&mdash;among the most remarkable
of whom were Johannes Poliaco, and Fitzralph,
Archbishop of Armagh, who was a dear
friend and chaplain of Richard de Bury's and many
learned disputations were carried on between them.<a name="FNanchor_187_187" id="FNanchor_187_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_187" class="fnanchor">[187]</a>
The celebrated oration of Fitzralph's, cited in the
presence of the pope, was a powerful blow to the
mendicant friars&mdash;an examination of the matter has
rather perplexed than cleared the subject, and I
find it difficult which side to favor, the clergy
seem to denounce the begging friars more from
envy and interested motives, for they looked with
extreme jealousy at the encroachments they had
made upon their ecclesiastical functions of confession,
absolution, etc., so profitable to the church in
those days. In these matters the church had
hitherto reserved a sole monopoly, and the clergy
now determined to protect it with all the powers of
oratorial denunciation; but, looking beyond this
veil of prejudice, I am prone to regard them favorably,
for their intense love of books, which
they sought for and bought up with passionate
eagerness. Fitzralph, quite unintentionally, bestows
a bright compliment upon them, and as it bears
upon our subject and illustrates the learning of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117"></a>[<a href="./images/117.png">117</a>]</span>
the time, I am tempted to give a few extracts; he
sorely laments the decrease of the number of students
in the university of Oxford; "So," says he,
"that yet in my tyme, in the universitie of Oxenford,
were thirty thousand Scolers at ones; and
now beth unnethe<a name="FNanchor_188_188" id="FNanchor_188_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_188" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> sixe thousand."<a name="FNanchor_189_189" id="FNanchor_189_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_189" class="fnanchor">[189]</a> All the
blame of this he lays to the friars, and accuses them
of doing "more grete damage to learning." "For
these orders of beggers, for endeless wynnynges
that thei geteth by beggyng of the forseide pryvyleges
of schriftes and sepultures and othere, thei
beth now so multiplyed in conventes and in persons.
That many men tellith that in general studies unnethe,

This strange accusation proves how industriously
the friars collected books, and we cannot help
regarding them with much esteem for doing so.
Richard de Bury fully admits his obligations to the
mendicants, from whom he obtained many choice
transcripts. "When indeed," says he, "we hap<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118"></a>[<a href="./images/118.png">118</a>]</span>pened
to turn aside to the towns and places where
the aforesaid paupers had convents, we were not
slack in visiting their chests and other repositories
of books, for there, amidst the deepest poverty, we
found the most exalted riches treasured up; there,
in their satchells and baskets, we discovered not
only the crumbs that fell from the master's table
for the little dogs, but indeed the shew bread without
leaven, the bread of angels, containing in itself
all that is delectable;<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins> and moreover, he says, that
he found these friars "not selfish hoarders, but
meet professors of enlightened knowledge."<a name="FNanchor_194_194" id="FNanchor_194_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_194" class="fnanchor">[194]</a></p>

<p>In the seventh chapter of his work, he deplores
the sad destruction of books by war and fire, and
laments the loss of the 700,000 volumes, which
happened in the Alexandrian expedition; but the
eighth chapter is the one which the bibliomaniac
will regard with the greatest interest, for Richard
de Bury tells us there how he collected together
his rich and ample library. "For although," he
writes, "from our youth we have ever been delighted
to hold special and social communion with literary
men and lovers of books, yet prosperity attending
us, having obtained the notice of his majesty the
king, and being received into his own family, we
acquired a most ample facility of visiting at pleasure
and of hunting, as it were, some of the most delightful
covers, the public and private libraries <i>privatas
tum communes</i>, both of the regulars and seculars.
Indeed, while we performed the duties of Chancellor
and Treasurer of the most invincible and ever
magnificently triumphant king of England, Ed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119"></a>[<a href="./images/119.png">119</a>]</span>ward
III., of that name after the conquest, whose
days may the Most High long and tranquilly deign
to preserve. After first inquiring into the things
that concerned his court, and then the public affairs
of his kingdom, an easy opening was afforded us,
under the countenance of royal favor, for freely
searching the hiding places of books. For the
flying fame of our love had already spread in all
directions, and it was reported not only that we had
a longing desire for books, and <i>especially for old
ones</i>, but that any one could more easily obtain our
favors by quartos than by money.<a name="FNanchor_195_195" id="FNanchor_195_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_195" class="fnanchor">[195]</a> Wherefore,
when supported by the bounty of the aforesaid
prince of worthy memory, we were enabled to
oppose or advance, to appoint or discharge; crazy
quartos and tottering folios, precious however in
our sight as well as in our affections, flowed in most
rapidly from the great and the small, instead of new
year's gift and remunerations, and instead of presents
and jewels. Then the cabinets of the most
noble monasteries <i>tunc nobilissimos monasterios</i>
were opened, cases were unlocked, caskets were
unclasped and sleeping volumes <i>soporata volumina</i>
which had slumbered for long ages in their sepulchres
were roused up, and those that lay hid in
dark places <i>in locis tenebrosis</i> were overwhelmed
with the rays of a new light. Books heretofore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120"></a>[<a href="./images/120.png">120</a>]</span>
most delicate now become corrupted and abominable,
lay lifeless, covered indeed with the excrements
of mice and pierced through with the gnawing
of worms; and those that were formerly clothed
with purple and fine linen were now seen reposing
in dust and ashes, given over to oblivion and the
abode of moths. Amongst these, nevertheless, as
time served, we sat down more voluptuously than
the delicate physician could do amidst his stores of
aromatics, and where we found an object of love,
we found also an assuagement. Thus the sacred
vessel of science came into the power of our disposal,
some being given, some sold, and not a few
lent for a time. Without doubt many who perceived
us to be contented with gifts of this kind,
studied to contribute these things freely to our use,
which they could most conveniently do without themselves.
We took care, however, to conduct the business
of such so favorably, that the profit might accrue
to them; justice suffered therefore no detriment."
Of this, however, a doubt will intrude itself upon
our minds, in defiance of the affirmation of my Lord
Chancellor; indeed, the paragraph altogether is unfavorable
to the character of so great a man, and
fully proves the laxity of opinion, in those days of
monkish supremacy, on judicial matters; but we
must be generous, and allow something for the
corrupt usages of the age, but I cannot omit a
circumstance clearly illustrative of this point, which
occurred between the bibliomanical Chancellor and
the abbot of St. Alban's, the affair is recorded in
the chronicle of the abbey, and transpired during
the time Richard de Bury held the privy seal; in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121"></a>[<a href="./images/121.png">121</a>]</span>
that office he appears to have favored the monks
of the abbey in their disputes with the townspeople
of St. Alban's respecting some possessions to which
the monks tenaciously adhered and defended as
their rightful property. Richard de Wallingford,
who was then abbot, convoked the elder monks
<i>convocatis senioribus</i>, and discussed with them, as to
the most effectual way to obtain the goodwill and
favor of de Bury; after due consideration it was
decided that no gift was likely to prove so acceptable
to that father of English bibliomania as a present
of some of their choice books, and it was at last
agreed to send four volumes, "that is to say Terence,
a Virgil, a Quintilian, and Jerome against Ruffinus,"
and to sell him many others from their library; this
they sent him intimation of, and a purchase was
ultimately agreed upon between them. The monks
sold to that rare collector, thirty-two choice tomes
<i>triginta duos libros</i>, for the sum of fifty pounds of
silver <i>quinginta libris argenti</i>.<a name="FNanchor_196_196" id="FNanchor_196_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_196" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> But there were other
bibliophiles and bookworms than Richard de Bury
in old England then; for many of the brothers of
St. Alban's who had nothing to do with this transaction,
cried out loudly against it, and denounced
rather openly the policy of sacrificing their mental
treasures for the acquisition of pecuniary gain, but
fortunately the loss was only a temporary one, for
on the death of Richard de Bury many of these
volumes were restored to the monks, who in return<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122"></a>[<a href="./images/122.png">122</a>]</span>
became the purchasers from his executors of many
a rare old volume from the bishop's library.<a name="FNanchor_197_197" id="FNanchor_197_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_197" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> To
resume our extracts from the Philobiblon, De Bury
proceeds to further particulars relative to his book-collecting
career, and becomes quite eloquent in
detailing these circumstances; but from the eighth
chapter we shall content ourselves with one more
paragraph. "Moreover," says he, "if we could
have amassed cups of gold and silver, excellent
horses, or no mean sums of money, we could in
those days have laid up abundance of wealth for
ourselves. But we regarded books not pounds,
and valued codices more than florens, and preferred
paltry pamphlets to pampered palfreys.<a name="FNanchor_198_198" id="FNanchor_198_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_198" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> In addition
to this we were charged with frequent embassies
of the said prince of everlasting memory,
and owing to the multiplicity of state affairs, we
were sent first to the Roman chair, then to the
court of France, then to the various other kingdoms
of the world, on tedious embassies and in
perilous times, carrying about with us that fondness
for books, which many waters could not extinguish."<a name="FNanchor_199_199" id="FNanchor_199_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_199" class="fnanchor">[199]</a>
The booksellers found Richard de Bury
a generous and profitable customer, and those<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123"></a>[<a href="./images/123.png">123</a>]</span>
residing abroad received commissions constantly
from him. "Besides the opportunities," he writes,
"already touched upon, we easily acquired the
notice of the stationers and librarians, not only
within the provinces of our native soil, but of those
dispersed over the kingdoms of France, Germany,
and Italy."<a name="FNanchor_200_200" id="FNanchor_200_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_200" class="fnanchor">[200]</a></p>

<p>Such was bibliomania five hundred years ago!
and does not the reader behold in it the very type
and personification of its existence now? does he
not see in Richard de Bury the prototype of a
much honored and agreeable bibliophile of our own
time? Nor has the renowned "Maister Dibdin"
described his book-hunting tours with more enthusiasm
or delight; with what a thrill of rapture
would that worthy doctor have explored those
monastic treasures which De Bury found hid in
<i>locis tenebrosis</i>, antique Bibles, rare Fathers, rich
Classics or gems of monkish lore, enough to fire
the brain of the most lymphatic bibliophile, were
within the grasp of the industrious and eager
Richard de Bury&mdash;that old "Amator Librorum,"
like his imitators of the present day, cared not
whither he went to collect his books&mdash;dust and
dirt were no barriers to him; at every nook and
corner where a stationer's stall<a name="FNanchor_201_201" id="FNanchor_201_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_201" class="fnanchor">[201]</a> appeared, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124"></a>[<a href="./images/124.png">124</a>]</span>
would doubtless tarry in defiance of the cold winds
or scorching sun, exploring the ancient tomes
reposing there. Nor did he neglect the houses
of the country rectors; and even the humble
habitations of the rustics were diligently ransacked
to increase his collections, and from these sources
he gleaned many rude but pleasing volumes, perhaps
full of old popular poetry! or the wild
Romances of Chivalry which enlivened the halls
and cots of our forefathers in Gothic days.</p>

<p>We must not overlook the fact that this
Treatise on the Love of Books was written as an
accompaniment to a noble and generous gift.
Many of the parchment volumes which De Bury
had collected in his "<i>perilous embassies</i>," he gave,
with the spirit of a true lover of learning, to the
Durham College at Oxford, for the use of the
Students of his Church. I cannot but regret that
the names of these books, <i>of which he had made a
catalogue</i>,<a name="FNanchor_202_202" id="FNanchor_202_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_202" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> have not been preserved; perhaps the
document may yet be discovered among the vast
collections of manuscripts in the Oxonian libraries;
but the book, being written for this purpose, the
author thought it consistent that full directions
should be given for the preservation and regulation
of the library, and we find the last chapter devoted
to this matter; but we must not close the Philobiblon
without noticing his admonitions to the
students, some of whom he upbraids for the care<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125"></a>[<a href="./images/125.png">125</a>]</span>lessness
and disrespect which they manifest in perusing
books. "Let there," says he, with all the
veneration of a passionate booklover, "be a modest
decorum in opening and closing of volumes, that
they may neither be unclasped with precipitous
haste, nor thrown aside after inspection without
being duly closed."<a name="FNanchor_203_203" id="FNanchor_203_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_203" class="fnanchor">[203]</a> Loving and venerating a
book as De Bury did, it was agony to see a volume
suffering under the indignities of the ignorant or
thoughtless student whom he thus keenly satirizes:
"You will perhaps see a stiffnecked youth lounging
sluggishly in his study, while the frost pinches him
in winter time; oppressed with cold his watery
nose drops, nor does he take the trouble to wipe it
with his handkerchief till it has moistened the book
beneath it with its vile dew;" nor is he "ashamed
to eat fruit and cheese over an open book, or to
transfer his empty cup from side to side; he reclines
his elbow on the volume, turns down the
leaves, and puts bits of straw to denote the place
he is reading; he stuffs the book with leaves and
flowers, and so pollutes it with filth and dust."
With this our extracts from the Philobiblon must
close; enough has been said and transcribed to
place the Lord Chancellor of the puissant King
Edward III. among the foremost of the bibliomaniacs
of the past, and to show how valuable
were his efforts to literature and learning; indeed,
like Petrarch in Italy was Richard De Bury in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126"></a>[<a href="./images/126.png">126</a>]</span>
England: both enthusiastic collectors and preservers
of ancient manuscripts, and both pioneers of
that revival of European literature which soon
afterwards followed. In the fourteenth century
we cannot imagine a more useful or more essential
person than the bibliomaniac, for that surely was
the harvest day for the gathering in of that food
on which the mind of future generations were to
subsist. And who reaped so laboriously or gleaned
so carefully as those two illustrious scholars?</p>

<p>Richard de Bury was no unsocial bookworm;
for whilst he loved to seek the intercourse of the
learned dead, he was far from being regardless of
the living. Next to his clasped vellum tomes,
nothing afforded him so much delight as an erudite
disputation with his chaplains, who were mostly
men of acknowledged learning and talent; among
them were "Thomas Bradwardyn, afterwards
Archbishop of Canterbury; and Richard Fitz-Raufe,
afterwards Archbishop of Armagh; Walter
Burley, John Maudyt, Robert Holcote, Richard of
Kilwington, all Doctors in Theology, <i>omnes Doctores
in Theologia</i>; Richard Benworth, afterwards
Bishop of London, and Walter Segraffe, afterwards
Bishop of Chester;"<a name="FNanchor_204_204" id="FNanchor_204_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_204" class="fnanchor">[204]</a> with these congenial spirits
Richard de Bury held long and pleasing conversations,
doubtless full of old bookwisdom and quaint
Gothic lore, derived from still quainter volumes;
and after meals I dare say they discussed the choice
volume which had been read during their repast, as
was the pious custom of those old days, and which
was not neglected by De Bury, for "his manner<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127"></a>[<a href="./images/127.png">127</a>]</span>
was at dinner and supper time to have some good
booke read unto him."<a name="FNanchor_205_205" id="FNanchor_205_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_205" class="fnanchor">[205]</a></p>

<p>And now in bidding farewell to the illustrious
Aungraville&mdash;for little more is known of his biography&mdash;let
me not forget to pay a passing tribute
of respect to his private character, which is right
worthy of a cherished remembrance, and derives its
principal lustre from the eminent degree in which
he was endowed with the greatest of Christian virtues,
and which, when practised with sincerity, covereth
a multitude of sins; his charity, indeed, forms
a delightful trait in the character of that great man;
every week he distributed food to the poor; eight
quarters of wheat <i>octo quarteria frumenti</i>, and the
fragments from his own table comforted the indigent
of his church; and always when he journeyed from
Newcastle to Durham, he distributed twelve marks
in relieving the distresses of the poor; from Durham
to Stockton eight marks; and from the same
place to his palace at Aukeland five marks; and
and when he rode from Durham to Middleham he
gave away one hundred shillings.<a name="FNanchor_206_206" id="FNanchor_206_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_206" class="fnanchor">[206]</a> Living in troublous
times, we do not find his name coupled with
any great achievement in the political sphere; his
talents were not the most propitious for a statesman
among the fierce barons of the fourteenth
century; his spirit loved converse with the departed
great, and shone more to advantage in the quite
closet of the bibliomaniac, or in fulfilling the benevolent
duties of a bishop. Yet he was successful
in all that the ambition of a statesman could desire,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128"></a>[<a href="./images/128.png">128</a>]</span>
the friend and confidant of his king; holding the
highest offices in the state compatible with his
ecclesiastical position, with wealth in abundance,
and blessed with the friendship of the learned and
the good, we find little in his earthly career to
darken the current of his existence, or to disturb
the last hours of a life of near three score years.
He died lamented, honored, and esteemed, at
Aukeland palace, on the fourteenth of April, in the
year 1345, in the fifty-eighth year of his age, and
was buried with all due solemnity before the altar
of the blessed Mary Magdalene, at the south angle
of the church of Durham. His bones are now
mingled with the dust and gone, but his memory is
engraven on tablets of life; the hearts of all bibliomaniacs
love and esteem his name for the many
virtues with which it was adorned, and delight to
chat with his choice old spirit in the Philobiblon,
so congenial to their bookish souls. No doubt the
illustrious example of Richard de Bury tended
materially to spread far and wide the spirit of bibliomania.
It certainly operated powerfully on the
monks of Durham, who not only by transcribing, but
at the cost of considerable sums of money, greatly
increased their library. A catalogue of the collection,
taken some forty years after the death of De
Bury, is preserved to this day at Durham, and
shows how considerably they augmented it during
a space of two hundred years, or from the time
when the former list was written. If the bibliomaniac
can obtain a sight of this ancient catalogue,
he will dwell over it with astonishment and delight&mdash;immaculate
volumes of Scripture&mdash;fathers and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129"></a>[<a href="./images/129.png">129</a>]</span>
classics bespeak its richness and extent, and Robert
of Langchester, the librarian who wrote it, with
pious preference places first on the list the magnificent
Bible which bishop Hugo gave them many
years before. This rare biblical treasure, then
the pride and glory of the collection, is now in the
Durham Library; but to look upon that fair manuscript
will make the blood run cold&mdash;barbarous
desecration has been committed by some bibliopegistical
hand; the splendid illuminations so rich
and spirited, which adorned the beauteous tomes,
dazzled an ignorant mind, who cut them out and
robbed it of half its interest and value.</p>

<p>From near 600 volumes which the list enumerates,
I cannot refrain from naming two or three.
I have searched over its biblical department in vain
to discover mention of the celebrated "Saint Cuthbert's
Gospels." It is surprising they should have
forgotten so rich a gem, for although four copies of
the Gospels appear, not one of them answers to its
description; two are specified as "<i>non glos</i>;" it
could not have been either of those, another, the
most interesting of the whole, is recorded as the
venerable Bede's own copy! What bibliophile can
look unmoved upon those time-honored pages,
without indeed all the warmth of his booklove
kindling forth into a very frenzy of rapture and
veneration! So fairly written, and so accurately
transcribed, it is one of the most precious of the
many gems which now crowd the shelves of the
Durham Library, and is well worth a pilgrimage to
view it.<a name="FNanchor_207_207" id="FNanchor_207_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_207" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> But this cannot be St. Cuthbert's Gospels,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130"></a>[<a href="./images/130.png">130</a>]</span>
and the remaining copy is mentioned as "<i>Quarteur
Evangelum</i>," fol. ii. "<i>se levantem</i>;" now I have
looked at the splendid volume in the British
Museum, to see if the catchword answered to this
description, but it does not; so it cannot be this,
which I might have imagined without the trouble
of a research, for if it was, they surely would not
have forgotten to mention its celebrated coopertoria.</p>

<p>Passing a splendid array of Scriptures whole
and in parts, for there was no paucity of sacred
volumes in that old monkish library, and fathers,
doctors of the Church, schoolmen, lives of saints,
chronicles, profane writers, philosophical and logical
treatises, medical works, grammars, and books
of devotion, we are particularly struck with the
appearance of so many fine classical authors.
Works of Virgil (including the &AElig;neid), Pompeius
Trogus, Claudius, Juvenal, Terence, Ovid, Prudentius,
Quintilian, Cicero, B&#339;thius, and a host of
others are in abundance, and form a catalogue
rendered doubly exciting to the bibliophile by the
insertion of an occasional note, which tells of its
antiquity,<a name="FNanchor_208_208" id="FNanchor_208_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_208" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> rarity, or value. In some of the volumes
a curious inscription was inserted, thundering
a curse upon any who would dare to pilfer it
from the library, and for so sacrilegious a crime,
calling down upon them the maledictions of Saints
Maria, Oswald, Cuthbert, and Benedict.<a name="FNanchor_209_209" id="FNanchor_209_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_209" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> A volume<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131"></a>[<a href="./images/131.png">131</a>]</span>
containing the lives of St. Cuthbert, St. Oswald,
and St. Aydani, is described as "<i>Liber speciales et
preciosus cum signaculo deaurato</i>."</p>

<p>Thomas Langley, who was chancellor of England
and bishop of Durham in the year 1406, collected
many choice books, and left some of them to
the library of Durham church; among them a copy
of Lyra's Commentaries stands conspicuous; he also
bequeathed a number of volumes to many of his
private friends.</p>

<p>There are few monastic libraries whose progress
we can trace with so much satisfaction as the one
now under consideration, for we have another catalogue
compiled during the librarianship of John
Tyshbourne, in the year 1416,<a name="FNanchor_210_210" id="FNanchor_210_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_210" class="fnanchor">[210]</a> in which many
errors appearing in the former ones are carefully
corrected; books which subsequent to that time
had been lost or stolen are here accounted for;
many had been sent to the students at Oxford, and
others have notes appended, implying to whom the
volume had been lent; thus to a "<i>Flores Bernardi</i>,"
occurs "<i>Prior debit, I Kempe Episcopi
Londoni</i>." It is, next to Monk Henry's of Canterbury,
one of the best of all the monkish catalogues
I have seen; not so much for its extent, as that
here and there it fully partakes of the character of
a catalogue <i>raisonn&eacute;</i>; for terse sentences are
affixed to some of the more remarkable volumes,
briefly descriptive of their value; a circumstance
seldom observable in these early attempts at
bibliography.</p>

<p>In taking leave of Durham library, need I say<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132"></a>[<a href="./images/132.png">132</a>]</span>
that the bibliomaniacs who flourished there in the
olden time, not only collected their books with so
much industry, but knew well how to use them too.
The reader is doubtless aware how many learned
men dwelled in monkish time within those ancient
walls; and if he is inquisitive about such things has
often enjoyed a few hours of pleasant chat over
the historic pages of Symeon of Durham,<a name="FNanchor_211_211" id="FNanchor_211_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_211" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> Turgot
and Wessington,<a name="FNanchor_212_212" id="FNanchor_212_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_212" class="fnanchor">[212]</a> and has often heard of brothers
Lawrence,<a name="FNanchor_213_213" id="FNanchor_213_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_213" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> Reginald,<a name="FNanchor_214_214" id="FNanchor_214_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_214" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> and Bolton; but although
unheeded now, many a monkish bookworm, glorying
in the strict observance of Christian humility,
and so unknown to fame, lies buried beneath that
splendid edifice, as many monuments and funeral
tablets testify and speak in high favor of the great
men of Durham. If the reader should perchance
to wander near that place, his eye will be attracted
by many of these memorials of the dead; and a
few hours spent in exploring them will serve to
gain many additional facts to his antiquarian lore,
and perhaps even something better too. For I
know not a more suitable place, as far as outward
circumstances are concerned, than an old sanctuary
of God to prepare the mind and lead it to think
of death and immortality. We read the names of
great men long gone; of wealthy worldlings, whose
fortunes have long been spent; of ambitious states<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133"></a>[<a href="./images/133.png">133</a>]</span>men
and doughty warriors, whose glory is fast fading
as their costly mausoleums crumble in the
hands of time, and whose stone tablets, green with
the lichens' hue, manifest how futile it is to hope to
gain immortality from stone, or purchase fame by
the cold marble trophies of pompous grief; not
that on their glassy surface the truth is always
faithfully mirrored forth, even when the thoughts
of holy men composed the eulogy; the tombs of old
knew as well how to lie as now, and even ascetic
monks could become too warm in their praises of
departed worth; for whilst they blamed the great
man living, with Christian charity they thought
only of his virtues when they had nothing but his
body left, and murmured long prayers, said tedious
masses, and kept midnight vigils for his soul. For
had he not shown his love to God by his munificence
to His Church on earth? <i>Benedicite</i>, saith
the monks.</p>

which I quote in giving my Latin Extracts. The first is in the
Cotton collection, marked Appendix iv. fol. 103. At the end are
these lines, <i>Ric. de Aungervile cognominato de Bury, Dunelm.
Episc. Philobiblon completum in Manerio de Auckland, d. 24 Jan.
1344</i>, fol. 119, b. The other is in the Harleian Collection, No. 3224,
both are in fine preservation. The first printed edition appeared at
Cologne, 1473, in 4to., without pagination, signatures, or catchwords,
with 48 leaves, 26 lines on a full page; for some time, on account of
its excessive rarity, which kept it from the eyes of book-lovers,
bibliographers confused it with the second edition printed by John
and Conrad H&uuml;st, at Spires, in 1483, 4to. which, like the first, is
without pagination, signatures, or catchwords, but it has only 39 pages,
with 31 lines on a full page. Two editions were printed in 1500, 4to.
at Paris, but I have only seen one of them. A fifth edition was
printed at Oxford by T. J(ames), 4to. 1599. In 1614 it was published
by Goldastus in 8vo. at Frankfort, with a <i>Philologicarium Epistolarum
Centuria una</i>. Another edition of this same book was printed
in 1674, 8vo. at Leipsic, and a still better edition appeared in 1703
by Schmidt, in 4to. The Philobiblon has recently been translated
by Inglis, 8vo. <i>Lond.</i> 1834, with much accuracy and spirit, and I
have in many cases availed myself of this edition, though I do not
always exactly follow it.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">he</span> low marshy fens of Lincolnshire
are particularly rich in
monastic remains; but none prove
so attractive to the antiquary as
the ruins of the splendid abbey of
Croyland. The pen of Ingulphus
has made the affairs of that old
monastery familiar to us; he has told us of its prospering
and its misfortunes, and we may learn moreover
from the pages of the monk how many wise
and virtuous men, of Saxon and Norman days,
were connected with this ancient fabric, receiving
education there, or devoting their lives to piety
within its walls. It was here that Guthlac, a Saxon
warrior, disgusted with the world, sought solitude<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136"></a>[<a href="./images/136.png">136</a>]</span>
and repose; and for ten long years he led a hermit's
life in that damp and marshy fen; in prayer and fasting,
working miracles, and leading hearts to God,
he spent his lonely days, all which was rewarded by
a happy and peaceful death, and a sanctifying of
his corporeal remains&mdash;for many wondrous miracles
were wrought by those holy relics.</p>

<p>Croyland abbey was founded on the site of
Guthlac's hermitage, by Ethelred, king of Mercia.
Many years before, when he was striving for the
crown of that kingdom, his cousin, Crobrid, who
then enjoyed it, pursued him with unremitting
enmity; and worn out, spiritless and exhausted, the
royal wanderer sought refuge in the hermit's cell.
The holy man comforted him with every assurance
of success; and prophesied that he would soon obtain
his rights without battle or without bloodshed;<a name="FNanchor_215_215" id="FNanchor_215_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_215" class="fnanchor">[215]</a>
in return for these brighter prospects, and these
kind wishes, Ethelred promised to found a monastery
on that very spot in honor of God and St.
Guthlac, which promise he faithfully fulfilled in the
year 716, and "thus the wooden oratory was followed
by a church of stone." Succeeding benefactors
endowed, and succeeding abbots enriched it
with their learning; and as years rolled by so it
grew and flourished till it became great in wealth
and powerful in its influence. But a gloomy day
approached&mdash;the Danes destroyed that noble structure,
devastating it by fire, and besmearing its holy
altars with the blood of its hapless inmates. But
zealous piety and monkish perseverance again
restored it, with new and additional lustre; and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137"></a>[<a href="./images/137.png">137</a>]</span>
besides adding to the splendor of the edifice, augmented
its internal comforts by forming a library
of considerable importance and value. We may
judge how dearly they valued a <i>Bibliotheca</i> in those
old days by the contribution of one benevolent
book-lover&mdash;Egebric, the second abbot of that
name, a man whom Ingulphus says was "far more
devoted to sacred learning and to the perusal of
books than skilled in secular matters,"<a name="FNanchor_216_216" id="FNanchor_216_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_216" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> gladdened
the hearts of the monks with a handsome library,
consisting of forty original volumes in various
branches of learning, and more than one hundred
volumes of different tracts and histories,<a name="FNanchor_217_217" id="FNanchor_217_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_217" class="fnanchor">[217]</a> besides
eighteen books for the use of the divine offices
of the church. Honor to the monk who, in the
land of dearth, could amass so bountiful a provision
for the intellect to feed upon; and who encouraged
our early literature&mdash;when feeble and
trembling by the renewed attacks of rapacious
invaders&mdash;by such fostering care.</p></div>

<p>In the eleventh century Croyland monastery
was doomed to fresh misfortunes; a calamitous fire,
accidental in its origin, laid the fine monastery
in a heap of ruins, and scattered its library in
blackened ashes to the winds.<a name="FNanchor_218_218" id="FNanchor_218_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_218" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> A sad and irre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138"></a>[<a href="./images/138.png">138</a>]</span>parable
loss was that to the Norman monks and
to the students of Saxon history in modern times;
for besides four hundred Saxon charters, deeds, etc.,
many of the highest historical interest and value
beautifully illuminated in gold (<i>aureis pictures</i>)
and written in Saxon characters,<a name="FNanchor_219_219" id="FNanchor_219_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_219" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> the whole of
the choice and ample library was burnt, containing
seven hundred volumes, besides the books of divine
offices&mdash;the Antiphons and Grailes. I will not
agonize the bibliophile by expatiating further on
the sad work of destruction; but is he not somewhat
surprised that in those bookless days seven
hundred volumes should have been amassed together,
besides a lot of church books and Saxon
times?</p>

<p>Ingulphus, who has so graphically described the
destruction of Croyland monastery by the Danes
in 870, has also given the particulars of their proceedings
at the monastery of Peterborough, anciently
called <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'Madeshamsted'">Medeshamstede</ins>, to which they immediately
afterwards bent their steps. The monks,
on hearing of their approach, took the precaution
to guard the monastery by all the means in their
power; but the quiet habits of monastic life were
ill suited to inspire them with a warlike spirit, and
after a feeble resistance, their cruel enemies (whom
the monks speak of in no gentle terms, as the
reader may imagine), soon effected an entrance;
in the contest however Tulla, the brother of
Hulda, the Danish leader, was slain by a stone
thrown by one of the monks from the walls; this
tended to kindle the fury of the besiegers, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139"></a>[<a href="./images/139.png">139</a>]</span>
so exasperated Hulda that it is said he killed with
his own hand the whole of the poor defenceless
monks, including their venerable abbot. The sacred
edifice, completely in their hands, was soon laid
waste; they broke down the altars, destroyed the
monuments, and&mdash;much will the bibliophile deplore
it&mdash;set fire to their immense library "<i>ingens bibliotheca</i>,"
maliciously tearing into pieces all their
valuable and numerous charters, evidences, and
writings. The monastery, says the historian, continued
burning for fifteen days.<a name="FNanchor_220_220" id="FNanchor_220_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_220" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> This seat of Saxon
learning was left buried in its ruins for near one
hundred years, when Athelwold, bishop of Winchester,
in the year 966, restored it; but in the course
of time, after a century of peaceful repose, fresh
troubles sprang up. When Turoldus, a Norman,
who had been appointed by William the Conqueror,
was abbot, the Danes again paid them a visit of
destruction. Hareward de Wake having joined a
Danish force, proceeded to the town of Peterborough;
fortunately the monks obtained some
intelligence of their coming, which gave Turoldus
time to repair to Stamford with his retinue. Taurus,
the Sacrist, also managed to get away, carrying with
him some of their treasures, and among them a
text of the Gospels, which he conveyed to his superior
at Stamford, and by that means preserved
them. On the arrival of the Danes, the remaining
monks were prepared to offer a somewhat stern
resistance, but without effect; for setting fire to the
buildings, the Danes entered through the flames
and smoke, and pillaged the monastery of all its<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140"></a>[<a href="./images/140.png">140</a>]</span>
valuable contents; and that which they could not
carry away, they destroyed: not even sparing the
shrines of holy saints, or the miracle-working dust
contained therein. The monks possessed a great
cross of a most costly nature, which the invaders
endeavored to take away, but could not on account
of its weight and size; however, they broke
off the gold crown from the head of the crucifix,
and the footstool under its feet, which was made of
pure gold and gems; they also carried away two
golden biers, on which the monks carried the relics
of their saints; with nine silver ones. There was
certainly no monachal poverty here, for their
wealth must have been profuse; besides the above
treasures, they took twelve crosses, made of gold
and silver; they also went up to the tower and
took away a table of large size and value, which
the monks had hid there, trusting it might escape
their search; it was a splendid affair, made of gold
and silver and precious stones, and was usually
placed before the altar. But besides all this, they
robbed them of that which those poor monkish bibliophiles
loved more than all. Their library, which
they had collected with much care, and which contained
many volumes, was carried away, "with
many other precious things, the like of which were
not to be found in all England."<a name="FNanchor_221_221" id="FNanchor_221_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_221" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> The abbot and
those monks who fortunately escaped, afterwards
returned, sad and sorrowful no doubt; but trusting
in their Divine Master and patron Saint, they ultimately
succeeded in making their old house habitable
again, and well fortified it with a strong wall,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141"></a>[<a href="./images/141.png">141</a>]</span>
so that formerly it used to be remarked that this
building looked more like a military establishment
than a house of God.</p>

<p>Eminently productive was the monastery of
Peterborough in Saxon bibliomaniacs. Its ancient
annals prove how enthusiastically they collected
and transcribed books. There were few indeed of
its abbots who did not help in some way or other
to increase their library. Kenulfus, who was abbot
in the year 992, was a learned and eloquent student
in divine and secular learning. He much improved
his monastery, and greatly added to its literary
treasures.<a name="FNanchor_222_222" id="FNanchor_222_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_222" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> But the benefactors of this place are
too numerous to be minutely specified here. Hugo
Candidus tells us, that Kinfernus, Archbishop of
York, in 1056, gave them many valuable ornaments;
and among them a fine copy of the Gospels,
beautifully adorned with gold. This puts us in
mind of Leofricus, a monk of the abbey, who was
made abbot in the year 1057. He is said to have
been related to the royal family, a circumstance
which may account for his great riches. He was a
sad pluralist, and held at one time no less than five
monasteries, viz. Burton, Coventy, Croyland,
Thorney, and Peterborough.<a name="FNanchor_223_223" id="FNanchor_223_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_223" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> He gave to the
church of Peterborough many and valuable utensils
of gold, silver, and precious stones, and a copy
of the Gospels bound in gold.<a name="FNanchor_224_224" id="FNanchor_224_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_224" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142"></a>[<a href="./images/142.png">142</a>]</span></p><p>But in all lights, whether regarded as an author
or a bibliophile, great indeed was Benedict, formerly
prior of Canterbury, and secretary to Thomas &agrave;
Becket,<a name="FNanchor_225_225" id="FNanchor_225_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_225" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> of whom it is supposed he wrote a life.
He was made abbot of Peterborough in the year
1177; he compiled a history of Henry II. and king
Richard I.;<a name="FNanchor_226_226" id="FNanchor_226_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_226_226" class="fnanchor">[226]</a> he is spoken of in the highest terms

wisdom and great erudition in secular matters.<a name="FNanchor_227_227" id="FNanchor_227_227"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_227" class="fnanchor">[227]</a>
There can be no doubt of his book-loving passion;
for during the time he was abbot he transcribed
himself, and ordered others to transcribe, a great
number of books. Swapham has preserved a catalogue
of them, which is so interesting that I have
transcribed it entire. The list is entitled:</p>

<p>Sixty volumes! perhaps containing near 100
separate works, and all added to the library in the
time of one abbot; surely this is enough to controvert
the opinion that the monks cared nothing for
books or learning, and let not the Justin, Seneca,
Martial, Terence, and Claudian escape the eye of
the reader, those monkish bookworms did care a
little, it would appear, for classical literature. But
what will he say to the fine Bibles that crown and
adorn the list? The two complete copies of the
<i>Vetus et Novum Testamentum</i>, and the many
glossed portions of the sacred writ, reflect honor
upon the Christian monk, and placed him conspicuously
among the bible students of the middle
ages; proving too, that while he could esteem the
wisdom of Seneca, and the vivacity of Terence, and
feel a deep interest in the secular history of his own
times, he did not lose sight of the fountain of all
knowledge, but gave to the Bible his first care, and
the most prominent place on his library shelf. Besides
the books which the abbots collected for the
monastery, they often possessed a private selection
for their own use; there are instances in which
these collections were of great extent; some of
which we shall notice, but generally speaking they
seldom numbered many volumes. Thus Robert of
Lyndeshye, who was abbot of Peterborough in
1214, only possessed six volumes, which were such<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145"></a>[<a href="./images/145.png">145</a>]</span>
as he constantly required for reference or devotion;
they consisted of a Numerale Majestri W. de Montibus
cum alliis rebus; Tropi Majestri Petri cum
diversis summis; Sententi&aelig; Petri Pretanensis;
Psalterium Glossatum; Aurora; Psalterium;<a name="FNanchor_229_229" id="FNanchor_229_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_229" class="fnanchor">[229]</a> Historiale.
These were books continually in requisition,
and which he possessed to save the trouble of
constantly referring to the library. His successor,
abbot Holdernesse, possessed also twelve volumes,<a name="FNanchor_230_230" id="FNanchor_230_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_230" class="fnanchor">[230]</a>
and Walter of St. Edmundsbury Abbot, in
1233, had eighteen books, and among them a fine
copy of the Bible for his private study. Robert of
Sutton in 1262, also abbot of Peterborough, possessed
a similar number, containing a copy of the
Liber Naturalium Anstotelis; and his successor,
Richard of London, among ten books which formed
his private library, had the Consolation of Philosophy,
a great favorite in the monasteries. In the
year 1295 William of Wodeforde, collected twenty
volumes, but less than that number constituted the
library of Adam de Botheby, who was abbot of
Peterborough many years afterwards, but among
them I notice a Seneca, with thirty-six others contained
in the same volume.<a name="FNanchor_231_231" id="FNanchor_231_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_231" class="fnanchor">[231]</a></p>

<p>Abbot Godfrey, elected in the year 1299, was a
great benefactor to the church, as we learn from
Walter de Whytlesse, who gives a long list of donations
made by him; among a vast quantity of
valuables, "he gave to the church <i>two Bibles</i>, one
of which was written in France," with about twenty<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146"></a>[<a href="./images/146.png">146</a>]</span>
other volumes. In the war which occurred during
his abbacy, between John Baliol of Scotland and
Edward I. of England, the Scots applied to the
pope for his aid and council; his holiness deemed
it his province to interfere, and directed letters to
the king of England, asserting that the kingdom of
Scotland appertained to the Church of Rome; in
these letters he attempt to prove that it was
opposed to justice, and, what he deemed of still
greater importance, to the interests of the holy see,
that the king of England should not have dominion
over the kingdom of Scotland. The pope's messengers
on this occasion were received by abbot
Godfrey; Walter says that "He honorably received
two cardinals at Peterborough with their retinues,
who were sent by the pope to make peace
between the English and the Scotch, and besides
cheerfully entertaining them with food and drink,
gave them divers presents; to one of the cardinals,
named Gaucelin, he gave a certain psalter, beautifully
written in letters of gold and purple, and
marvellously illuminated, <i>literis aureis et assuris
scriptum et mirabiliter luminatum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_232_232" id="FNanchor_232_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_232" class="fnanchor">[232]</a> I give this
anecdote to show how splendidly the monks inscribed
those volumes designed for the service of the holy
church. I ought to have mentioned before that
Wulstan, archbishop of York, gave many rare and
precious ornaments to Peterborough, nor should I
omit a curious little book anecdote related of him.
He was born at Jceritune in Warwickshire, and was
sent by his parents to Evesham, and afterwards to
Peterborough, where he gave great indications of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147"></a>[<a href="./images/147.png">147</a>]</span>
learning. His schoolmaster, who was an Anglo-Saxon
named Erventus, was a clever calligraphist,
and is said to have been highly proficient in the art
of illuminating; he instructed Wulstan in these
accomplishments, who wrote under his direction a
sacramentary and a psalter, and illuminated the
capitals with many pictures painted in gold and
colors; they were executed with so much taste
that his master presented the sacramentary to
Canute, and the psalter to his queen.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_233_233" id="FNanchor_233_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_233" class="fnanchor">[233]</a></p>

<p>From these few facts relative to Peterborough
Monastery, the reader will readily perceive how
earnestly books were collected by the monks there,
and will be somewhat prepared to learn that a
catalogue of 1,680 volumes is preserved, which
formerly constituted the library of that fraternity
of bibliophiles. This fine old catalogue, printed
by Gunton in his history of the abbey, covers
fifty folio pages; it presents a faithful mirror of
the literature of its day, and speaks well for the
bibliomanical spirit of the monks of Peterborough.
Volumes of patristic eloquence and pious erudition
crowd the list; chronicles, poetry, and philosophical
treatises are mingled with the titles of an abundant
collection of classic works, full of the lore of the
ancient world. Although the names may be similar
to those which I have extracted from other catalogues,
I must not omit to give a few of them;

<p>But although they possessed these fine authors
and many others equally choice, I am not able
to say much for the biblical department of their
library, I should have anticipated a goodly store of
the Holy Scriptures, but in these necessary volumes
they were unusually poor. But I suspect the catalogue
to have been compiled during the fifteenth
century, and I fear too, that in that age the monks
were growing careless of Scripture reading, or at
least relaxing somewhat in the diligence of their
studies; perhaps they devoured the attractive pages
of Ovid, and loved to read his amorous tales more
than became the holiness of their priestly calling.<a name="FNanchor_234_234" id="FNanchor_234_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_234" class="fnanchor">[234]</a>
At any rate we may observe a marked change as
regards the prevalence of the Bible in monastic
libraries between the twelfth and the fifteenth
century. It is true we often find them in those of
the later age; but sometimes they are entirely
without, and frequently only in detached portions.<a name="FNanchor_235_235" id="FNanchor_235_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_235" class="fnanchor">[235]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149"></a>[<a href="./images/149.png">149</a>]</span>
I may illustrate this by a reference to the library of
the Abbey of St. Mary de la Pr&eacute; at Leicester, which
gloried in a collection of 600 volumes, of the choicest
and almost venerable writers. It was written in the
year 1477, by William Chartye,<a name="FNanchor_236_236" id="FNanchor_236_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_236" class="fnanchor">[236]</a> prior of the abbey,
and an old defective and worn out Bible, <i>Biblie
defect et usit</i>, with some detached portions, was all
that fine library contained of the Sacred Writ.
The bible <i>defect et usit</i> speaks volumes to the praise
of the ancient monks of that house, for it was by
their constant reading and study, that it had become
so thumbed and worn; but it stamps with disgrace
the affluent monks of the fifteenth century, who,
while they could afford to buy, in the year 1470,<a name="FNanchor_237_237" id="FNanchor_237_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_237" class="fnanchor">[237]</a>
some thirty volumes with a Seneca, Ovid, Claudian,
Macrobius, &AElig;sop, etc., among them, and who found
time to transcribe twice as many more, thought not
of restoring their bible tomes, or adding one book
of the Holy Scripture to their crowded shelves.
But alas! monachal piety was waxing cool and
indifferent then, and it is rare to find the honorable
title of an <i>Amator Scripturarum</i> affixed to a
monkish name in the latter part of the fifteenth
century.</p>

<div class="clearfix"><div class="figleft"><img src="./images/ill-11.jpg" alt="T" title="T" /></div>
<p><span class="smcap">he</span> latter part of the tenth century
was a most memorable period in
the annals of monkish bibliomania,
and gave birth to one of
the brightest scholars that ever
shone in the dark days of our
Saxon forefathers. King Alfred,
in honor of whose talents posterity have gratefully
designated the Great, spread a fostering care over
the feeble remnant of native literature which the
Danes in their cruel depredations had left unmolested.
The noble aspirations of this royal student
and patron of learning had been instilled into his
mind by the tender care of a fond parent. It was
from the pages of a richly illuminated little volume
of Saxon poetry, given to him by the queen as a
reward for the facility with which he had mastered
its contents, that he first derived that intense love
of books which never forsook him, though the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152"></a>[<a href="./images/152.png">152</a>]</span>
sterner duties of his after position frequently
required his thoughts and energies in another
channel. Having made himself acquainted with
this little volume, Alfred found a thirst for knowledge
grow upon him, and applied his youthful
mind to study with the most zealous ardor; but
his progress was considerably retarded, because he
could not, at that time, find a Grammaticus capable
of instructing him,<a name="FNanchor_238_238" id="FNanchor_238_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_238" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> although he searched the kingdom
of the West Saxons. Yet he soon acquired
the full knowledge of his own language, and the
Latin it is said he knew as well, and was able to
use with a fluency equal to his native tongue; he
could comprehend the meaning of the Greek,
although perhaps he was incapable of using it to
advantage. He was so passionately fond of books,
and so devoted to reading, that he constantly
carried about him some favorite volume which, as
a spare moment occurred, he perused with the
avidity of an <i>helluo librorum</i>. This pleasing anecdote
related by Asser<a name="FNanchor_239_239" id="FNanchor_239_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_239" class="fnanchor">[239]</a> is characteristic of his
natural perseverance.</p></div>

<p>When he ascended the throne, he lavished
abundant favors upon all who were eminent for
their literary acquirements; and displayed in their
distribution the utmost liberality and <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'descrimination'">discrimination</ins>.
Asser, who afterwards became his biographer,
was during his life the companion and
associate of his studies, and it is from his pen we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153"></a>[<a href="./images/153.png">153</a>]</span>
learn that, when an interval occurred inoccupied by
his princely duties, Alfred stole into the quietude of
his study to seek comfort and instruction from the
pages of those choice volumes, which comprised
his library. But Alfred was not a mere bookworm,
a devourer of knowledge without purpose or without
meditation of his own, he thought with a student's
soul well and deeply upon what he read, and drew
from his books those principles of philanthropy, and
those high resolves, which did such honor to the
Saxon monarch. He viewed with sorrow the
degradation of his country, and the intellectual
barrenness of his time; the warmest aspiration of
his soul was to diffuse among his people a love for
literature and science, to raise them above their
Saxon sloth, and lead them to think of loftier
matters than war and carnage. To effect this
noble aim, the highest to which the talents of a
monarch can be applied, he for a length of time
devoted his mind to the translation of Latin authors
into the vernacular tongue. In his preface to the
Pastoral of Gregory which he translated, he laments
the destruction of the old monastic libraries by the
Danes. "I saw," he writes, "before alle were
spoiled and burnt, how the churches throughout
Britain were filled with treasures and books,"<a name="FNanchor_240_240" id="FNanchor_240_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_240" class="fnanchor">[240]</a>
which must have presented a striking contrast to
the illiterate darkness which he tells us afterwards
spread over his dominions, for there were then
very few <i>paucissimi</i> who could translate a Latin
epistle into the Saxon language.</p>

<p>When Alfred had completed the translation of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154"></a>[<a href="./images/154.png">154</a>]</span>
Gregory's Pastoral, he sent a copy to each of his
bishops accompanied with a golden stylus or pen,<a name="FNanchor_241_241" id="FNanchor_241_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_241" class="fnanchor">[241]</a>
thus conveying to them the hint that it was their
duty to use it in the service of piety and learning.
Encouraged by the favorable impression which
this work immediately caused, he spared no pains
to follow up the good design, but patiently applied
himself to the translation of other valuable books
which he rendered into as pleasing and expressive a
version as the language of those rude times permitted.
Besides these literary labors he also wrote
many original volumes, and became a powerful
orator, a learned grammarian, an acute philosopher,
a profound mathematician, and the prince of
Saxon poesy; with these exalted talents he united
those of an historian, an architect, and an accomplished
musician. A copious list of his productions,
the length of which proves the fertility of his pen,
will be found in the Biographica Britannica,<a name="FNanchor_242_242" id="FNanchor_242_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_242" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> but

found in monkish chronicles; of his Manual, which
was in existence in the time of William of Malmsbury,
not a fragment has been found. The last of
his labors was probably an attempt to render the
psalms into the common language, and so unfold
that portion of the Holy Scriptures to our Saxon
ancestors.</p>

<p>Alfred, with the assistance of the many learned
men whom he had called to his court, restored the
monasteries and schools of learning which the
Danes had desecrated, and it is said founded the
university of Oxford, where he built three halls, in
the name of the Holy Trinity; for the doctors of
divinity, philosophy, and grammar. The controversy
which this subject has given rise to among
the learned is too long to enter into here, although
the matter is one of great interest to the scholar
and to the antiquary.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">he</span> venerable Bede enables us to
show that in the early Saxon days
the monasteries of Wearmouth
and Jarrow possessed considerable
collections of books. Benedict
Biscop, the most enthusiastic bibliomaniac
of the age, founded the
monastery of Wearmouth in the year 674, in honor
of the "Most Holy Prince of the Apostles." His
whole soul was in the work, he spared neither pains
or expense to obtain artists of well known and
reputed talent to decorate the holy edifice; not finding
them at home, he journeyed to Gaul in search
of them, and returned accompanied by numerous
expert and ingenious workmen. Within a year the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158"></a>[<a href="./images/158.png">158</a>]</span>
building was sufficiently advanced to enable the
monks to celebrate divine service there. He
introduced glass windows and other ornaments into
his church, and furnished it with numerous books
of all descriptions, <i>innumerabilem librorum omnis
generis</i>. Benedict was so passionately fond of
books that he took five journeys to Rome for the
purpose of collecting them. In his third voyage
he gathered together a large quantity on divine
erudition; some of these he bought, or received
them as presents from his friends, <i>vel amicorum
dono largitos retulit</i>. When he arrived at Vienne
on his way home, he collected others which he had
commissioned his friends to purchase for him.<a name="FNanchor_245_245" id="FNanchor_245_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_245" class="fnanchor">[245]</a>
After the completion of his monastery he undertook
his fourth journey to Rome; he obtained from
the Pope many privileges for the abbey, and
returned in the year 680, bringing with him many
more valuable books; he was accompanied by John
the Chantor, who introduced into the English
churches the Roman method of singing. He was
also a great <i>amator librorum</i>, and left many choice
manuscripts to the monks, which Bede writes "were
still preserved in their library." It was about this
time that Ecgfrid<a name="FNanchor_246_246" id="FNanchor_246_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_246" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> gave Benedict a portion of land
on the other side of the river Wire, at a place
called Jarrow; and that enterprising and indus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159"></a>[<a href="./images/159.png">159</a>]</span>trious
abbot, in the year 684, built a monastery
thereon. No sooner was it completed, than he
went a fifth time to Rome to search for volumes to
gratify his darling passion. This was the last, but
perhaps the most successful of his foreign tours,
for he brought back with him a vast quantity of
sacred volumes and curious pictures.<a name="FNanchor_247_247" id="FNanchor_247_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_247" class="fnanchor">[247]</a> How deeply
is it to be regretted that the relation of the travels
which Ceolfrid his successor undertook, and which
it is said his own pen inscribed, has been lost to us
forever. He probably spoke much of Benedict in
the volume and recorded his book pilgrimages.
How dearly would the bibliomaniac revel over
those early annals of his science, could his eye
meet those venerable pages&mdash;perhaps describing
the choice tomes Benedict met with in his Italian
tours, and telling us how, and what, and where he
gleaned those fine collections; sweet indeed would
have been the perusal of that delectable little volume,
full of the book experience of a bibliophile
in Saxon days, near twelve hundred years ago!
But the ravages of time or the fury of the Danes
deprived us of this rare gem, and we are alone
dependent on Bede for the incidents connected with
the life of this great man; we learn from that
venerable author that Benedict was seized with the
palsy on his return, and that languishing a few
short years, he died in the year 690; but through
pain and suffering he often dwelt on the sweet
treasures of his library, and his solemn thoughts of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160"></a>[<a href="./images/160.png">160</a>]</span>
death and immortality were intermixed with many
a fond bookish recollection. <i>His most noble and
abundant library which he brought from Rome</i> he
constantly referred to, and gave strict injunctions
that the monks should apply the utmost care to
the preservation of that rich and costly treasure, in
the collection of which so many perils and anxious
years were spent.<a name="FNanchor_248_248" id="FNanchor_248_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_248" class="fnanchor">[248]</a></p></div>

<p>We all know the force of example, and are not
surprised that the sweet mania which ruled so
potently over the mind of Benedict, spread itself
around the crowned head of royalty. Perhaps
book collecting was beginning to make "a stir,"
and the rich and powerful among the Saxons were
regarding strange volumes with a curious eye.
Certain it is that Egfride, or &AElig;lfride, the proud
king of Northumbria,<a name="FNanchor_249_249" id="FNanchor_249_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_249" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> fondly coveted a beautiful
copy of the geographer's (<i>codice mirandi operis</i>),
which Benedict numbered among his treasures;
and so eagerly too did he desire its possession,
that he gave in exchange a portion of eight hides
of land, near the river Fresca, for the volume; and
Ceolfrid, Benedict's successor, received it.</p>

<p>How useful must Benedict's library have been in
ripening the mind that was to cast a halo of im<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161"></a>[<a href="./images/161.png">161</a>]</span>mortality
around that old monastery, and to
generate a renown which was long to survive the
grey walls of that costly fane; for whilst we now
fruitlessly search for any vestiges of its former
being, we often peruse the living pages of Bede
the venerable with pleasure and instruction, and
we feel refreshed by the breath of piety and devotion
which they unfold; yet it must be owned the
superstition of Rome will sometimes mar a devout
prayer and the simplicity of a Christian thought.
But all honor to his manes and to his memory! for
how much that is admirable in the human character&mdash;how
much sweet and virtuous humility was hid
in him, in the strict retirement of the cloister. The
writings of that humble monk outlive the fame of
many a proud ecclesiastic or haughty baron of his
day; and well they might, for how homely does his
pen record the simple annals of that far distant age.
Much have the old monks been blamed for their
bad Latin and their humble style; but far from
upbraiding, I would admire them for it; for is not
the inelegance of diction which their unpretending
chronicles display, sufficiently compensated by their
charming simplicity. As for myself, I have sometimes
read them by the blaze of my cheerful hearth,
or among the ruins of some old monastic abbey,<a name="FNanchor_250_250" id="FNanchor_250_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_250" class="fnanchor">[250]</a>
till in imagination I beheld the events which they<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162"></a>[<a href="./images/162.png">162</a>]</span>
attempt to record, and could almost hear the voice
of the "<i>goode olde monke</i>" as he relates the deeds
of some holy man&mdash;in language so natural and
idiomatic are they written.</p>

<p>But as we were saying, Bede made ample use of
Benedict's library; and the many Latin and Greek
books, which he refers to in the course of his writings,
were doubtless derived from that source.<a name="FNanchor_251_251" id="FNanchor_251_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_251" class="fnanchor">[251]</a>
Ceolfrid, the successor of Benedict, "a man of great
zeal, of acute wisdom, and bold in action," was a
great lover of books, and under his care the libraries
of Wearmouth and Jarrow became nearly doubled
in extent; of the nature of these additions we are
unable to judge, but probably they were not contemptible.<a name="FNanchor_252_252" id="FNanchor_252_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_252" class="fnanchor">[252]</a></p>

<p>Wilfrid, bishop of Northumbria, was a dear and
intimate friend of Biscop's, and was the companion
of one of his pilgrimages to Rome. In his early
youth he gave visible signs of a heart full of religion
and piety, and he sought by a steady perusal of the
Holy Scriptures, in the little monastery of Lindesfarne,
to garnish his mind with that divine lore
with which he shone so brightly in the Saxon
church. It was at the court of Ercenbyrht, king<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163"></a>[<a href="./images/163.png">163</a>]</span>
of Kent, that he met with Benedict Biscop; and
the sympathy which their mutual learning engendered
gave rise to a warm and devoted friendship
between them. Both inspired with an ardent desire
to visit the apostolic see, they set out together for
Rome;<a name="FNanchor_253_253" id="FNanchor_253_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_253" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> and it was probably by the illustrious
example of his fellow student and companion, that
Wilfrid imbibed that book-loving passion which he
afterwards displayed on more than one occasion.
On his return from Rome, Alfred of Northumbria
bestowed upon him the monastery of Rhypum<a name="FNanchor_254_254" id="FNanchor_254_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_254" class="fnanchor">[254]</a> in
the year 661, and endowed it with certain lands.
Peter of Blois records, in his life of Wilfrid, that
this "man of God" gave the monastery a copy of
the gospels, a library, and many books of the Old
and New Testament, with certain tablets made with
marvellous ingenuity, and ornamented with gold
and precious stones.<a name="FNanchor_255_255" id="FNanchor_255_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_255" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> Wilfrid did not long remain
in the monastery of Ripon, but advanced to higher
honors, and took a more active part in the ecclesiastical
affairs of the time.<a name="FNanchor_256_256" id="FNanchor_256_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_256" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> But I am not about to
pursue his history, or to attempt to show how his
hot and imperious temper, or the pride and avarice
of his disposition, wrought many grievous animosities
in the Saxon church; or how by his prelatical
ambition he deservedly lost the friendship of his
King and his ecclesiastical honors.<a name="FNanchor_257_257" id="FNanchor_257_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_257" class="fnanchor">[257]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164"></a>[<a href="./images/164.png">164</a>]</span></p><p>About this time, and contemporary with Bede,
we must not omit one who appears as a bright star
in the early Christian church. Boniface,<a name="FNanchor_258_258" id="FNanchor_258_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_258" class="fnanchor">[258]</a> the
Saxon missionary, was remarked by his parents to
manifest at an early age signs of that talent which
in after years achieved so much, and advanced so
materially the interests of piety and the cause of
civilization. When scarcely four years old his
infant mind seemed prone to study, which growing
upon him as he increased in years, his parent
placed him in the monastery of Exeter. His stay
there was not of long duration, for he shortly after
removed to a monastery in Hampshire under the
care of Wybert. In seclusion and quietude he
there studied with indefatigable ardor, and fortified
his mind with that pious enthusiasm and profound
erudition, which enabled him in a far distant country
to render such service to the church. He was made
a teacher, and when arrived at the necessary age he
was ordained priest. In the year 710, a dispute
having occurred among the western church of the
Saxons, he was appointed to undertake a mission
to the archbishop of Canterbury on the subject.
Pleased perhaps with the variety and bustle of
travel, and inspired with a holy ambition, he determined
to attempt the conversion of the German<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165"></a>[<a href="./images/165.png">165</a>]</span>
people, who, although somewhat acquainted with
the gospel truths, had nevertheless deviated materially
from the true faith, and returned again to
their idolatry and paganism. Heedless of the
danger of the expedition, but looking forward only
to the consummation of his fond design, he started
on his missionary enterprise, accompanied by one
or two of his monkish brethren.</p>

<p>He arrived at Friesland in the year 716, and
proceeded onwards to Utrecht; but disappointments
and failures awaited him. The revolt of the
Frieslanders and the persecution then raging there
against the Christians, dissipated his hopes of usefulness;
and with a heavy heart, no doubt, Boniface
retraced his steps, and re-embarked for his English
home. Yet hope had not deserted him&mdash;his philanthropic
resolutions were only delayed for a time;
for no sooner had the dark clouds of persecution
passed away than his adventurous spirit burst
forth afresh, and shone with additional lustre and
higher aspirations. After an interval of two years
we find him again starting on another Christian
mission. On reaching France he proceeded immediately
to Rome, and procured admission to the
Pope, who, ever anxious for the promulgation of
the faith and for the spiritual dominion of the
Roman church, highly approved of the designs of
Boniface, and gave him letters authorizing his
mission among the Thuringians; invested with
these powers and with the pontifical blessing, he
took his departure from the holy city, well stored
with the necessary ornaments and utensils for the
performance of the ecclesiastical rites, besides a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166"></a>[<a href="./images/166.png">166</a>]</span>
number of books to instruct the heathens and to
solace his mind amidst the cares and anxieties of his
travels. After some few years the fruits of his
labor became manifest, and in 723 he had baptized
vast multitudes in the true faith. His success was
perhaps unparalleled in the early annals of the
church, and remind us of the more recent wonders
wrought by the Jesuit missionaries in India.<a name="FNanchor_259_259" id="FNanchor_259_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_259" class="fnanchor">[259]</a>
Elated with these happy results, far greater than
even his sanguine mind had anticipated, he sent a
messenger to the Pope to acquaint his holiness of
these vast acquisitions to his flock, and soon after
he went himself to Rome to receive the congratulations
and thanks of the Pontiff; he was then made
bishop, and entrusted with the ecclesiastical direction
of the new church. After his return, he spent
many years in making fresh converts and maintaining
the discipline of the faithful. But all these
labors and these anxieties were terminated by a
cruel and unnatural death; on one of his expeditions
he was attacked by a body of pagans, who slew him
and nearly the whole of his companions, but it is not
here that a Christian must look for his reward&mdash;he
must rest his hopes on the benevolence and mercy
of his God in a distant and far better world. He
who would wish to trace more fully these events,
and so catch a glimpse of the various incidents<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167"></a>[<a href="./images/167.png">167</a>]</span>
which touch upon the current of his life, must not
keep the monk constantly before his mind, he must
sometimes forget him in that capacity and regard
him as a <i>student</i>, and that too in the highest
acceptation of the term. His youthful studies,
which I have said before were pursued with unconquerable
energy, embraced grammar, poetry, rhetoric,
history, and the exposition of the Holy
Scriptures; the Bible, indeed, he read unceasingly,
and drew from it much of the vital truth with which
it is inspired; but he perhaps too much tainted it
with traditional interpretation and patristical logic.
A student's life is always interesting; like a rippling
stream, its unobtrusive gentle course is ever pleasing
to watch, and the book-worms seems to find in
it the counterpart of his own existence. Who can
read the life and letters of the eloquent Cicero, or
the benevolent Pliny, without the deepest interest;
or mark their anxious solicitude after books, without
sincere delight. Those elegant epistles reflect the
image of their private studies, and so to behold
Boniface in a student's garb, to behold his love of
books and passion for learning, we must alike have
recourse to his letters.</p>

<p>The epistolary correspondence of the middle
ages is a mirror of those times, far more faithful as
regards their social condition than the old chronicles
and histories designed for posterity; written
in the reciprocity of friendly civilities, they contain
the outpourings of the heart, and enable us to peep
into the secret thoughts and motives of the writer;
"for out of the fulness of the hearth the mouth
speaketh." Turning over the letters of Boniface,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168"></a>[<a href="./images/168.png">168</a>]</span>
we cannot but be forcibly struck with his great
knowledge of Scripture; his mind seems to have
been quite a concordance in itself, and we meet
with epistles almost solely framed of quotations
from the sacred books, in substantiation of some
principle, or as grounds for some argument advanced.
These are pleasurable instances, and
convey a gentle hint that the greater plenitude of
the Bible has not, in all cases, emulated us to
study it with equal energy; there are few who
would now surpass the Saxon bishop in biblical
reading.</p>

<p>Most students have felt, at some period or
other, a thirst after knowledge without the means
of assuaging it&mdash;have felt a craving after books
when their pecuniary circumstances would not
admit of their acquisition, such will sympathize
with Boniface, the student in the wilds of Germany,
who, far from monastic libraries, sorely
laments in some of his letters this great deprivation,
and entreats his friends, sometimes in most
piteous terms, to send him books. In writing to
Daniel, Bishop of Winchester, he asks for copies,
and begs him to send the book of the six prophets,
clearly and distinctly transcribed, and in large
letters because his sight he says was growing
weak; and because the book of the prophets was
much wanted in Germany, and could not be obtained
except written so obscurely, and the letters
so confusedly joined together, as to be scarcely
readable <i>ac connexas litteras discere non possum</i>.<a name="FNanchor_260_260" id="FNanchor_260_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_260" class="fnanchor">[260]</a>
To "Majestro Lul" he writes for the productions<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169"></a>[<a href="./images/169.png">169</a>]</span>
of bishop Aldhelm, and other works of prose,
poetry, and rhyme, to console him in his peregrinations
<i>ad consolationem peregrinationis me&aelig;</i>.<a name="FNanchor_261_261" id="FNanchor_261_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_261" class="fnanchor">[261]</a> With
Abbess Eadburge he frequently corresponded, and
received from her many choice and valuable volumes,
transcribed by her nuns and sometimes by
her own hands; at one period he writes in glowing
terms and with a grateful pen for the books thus
sent him, and at another time he sends for a copy of
the Gospels. "Execute," says he, "a glittering
lamp for our hands, and so illuminate the hearts of
the Gentiles to a study of the Gospels and to the
glory of Christ; and intercede, I pray thee, with
your pious prayers for these pagans who are committed
by the apostles to our care, that by the
mercy of the Saviour of the world they may be
delivered from their idolatrous practices, and united
to the congregation of mother church, to the honor
of the Catholic faith, and to the praise and glory
of His name, who will have all men to be saved,
and to come unto the knowledge of the truth.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_262_262" id="FNanchor_262_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_262" class="fnanchor">[262]</a></p>

<p>All this no doubt the good abbess faithfully
fulfilled; and stimulated by his friendship and these
encouraging epistles, she set all the pens in her
monastery industriously to work, and so gratified
the Saxon missionary with those book treasures,
which his soul so ardently loved; certain it is, that
we frequently find him thanking her for books, and
with famishing eagerness craving for more; one of
his letters,<a name="FNanchor_263_263" id="FNanchor_263_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_263" class="fnanchor">[263]</a> full of gratitude, he accompanies with
a present of a silver graphium, or writing instru<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170"></a>[<a href="./images/170.png">170</a>]</span>ment,
and soon after we find him thus addressing
her:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"To the most beloved sister, Abbess Eadburge, and all now
joined to her house and under her spiritual care. Boniface, the
meanest servant of God, wisheth eternal health in Christ."</p></div>

<p>"My dearest sister, may your assistance be
abundantly rewarded hereafter in the mansions of
the angels and saints above, for the kind presents
of books which you have transmitted to me. Germany
rejoices in their spiritual light and consolation,
because they have spread lustre into, the dark
hearts of the German people; for except we have
a lamp to guide our feet, we may, in the words of
the Lord, fall into the snares of death. Moreover,
through thy gifts I earnestly hope to be more
diligent, so that my country may be honored, my
sins forgiven, and myself protected from the perils
of the sea and the violence of the tempest; and
that He who dwells on high may lightly regard my
transgression, and give utterance to the words of
my mouth, that the Gospel may have free course,
and be glorified among men to the honor of
Christ."<a name="FNanchor_264_264" id="FNanchor_264_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_264" class="fnanchor">[264]</a></p>

<p>Writing to Egbert, Archbishop of York, of
whose bibliomaniacal character and fine library we
have yet to speak, Boniface thanks that illustrious
collector for the choice volumes he had kindly sent
him, and further entreats Egbert to procure for
him transcripts of the smaller works <i>opusculi</i> and
other tracts of Bede, "who, I hear," he writes,
"has, by the divine grace of the Holy Spirit, been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171"></a>[<a href="./images/171.png">171</a>]</span>
permitted to spread such lustre over your country."<a name="FNanchor_265_265" id="FNanchor_265_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_265" class="fnanchor">[265]</a>
These, that kind and benevolent prelate sent to
him with other books, and received a letter full of
gratitude in return, but with all the boldness of a
hungry student still asking for more! especially for
Bede's Commentary on the Parables of Solomon.<a name="FNanchor_266_266" id="FNanchor_266_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_266" class="fnanchor">[266]</a>
He sents to Archbishop Nothelm for a copy of the
Questions of St. Augustine to Pope Gregory, with
the answers of the pope, which he says he could
not obtain from Rome; and in writing to Cuthbert,
also Archbishop of Canterbury, imploring the aid
of his earnest prayers, he does not forget to ask for
books, but hopes that he may be speedily comforted
with the works of Bede, of whose writings he was
especially fond, and was constantly sending to his
friends for transcripts of them. In a letter to
Huetberth he writes for the "most sagacious dissertations
of the monk Bede,"<a name="FNanchor_267_267" id="FNanchor_267_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_267" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> and to the Abbot
Dudde he sends a begging message for the Commentaries
on the Epistles of Paul to the Romans
and to the Corinthians<a name="FNanchor_268_268" id="FNanchor_268_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_268" class="fnanchor">[268]</a> by the same. In a letter
to Lulla, Bishop of Coena, he deplores the want of
books on the phenomena and works of nature,
which, he says, were <i>omnio incognitum</i> there, and
asks for a book on Cosmography;<a name="FNanchor_269_269" id="FNanchor_269_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_269" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> and on another
occasion Lulla supplied Boniface with many portions
of the Holy Scriptures, and Commentaries
upon them.<a name="FNanchor_270_270" id="FNanchor_270_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_270" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Many more of his epistles might be
quoted to illustrate the Saxon missionary as an
"<i>amator librorum</i>," and to display his profound<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172"></a>[<a href="./images/172.png">172</a>]</span>
erudition. In one of his letters we find him referring
to nearly all the celebrated authors of the
church, and so aptly, that we conclude he must
have had their works on his desk, and was deeply
read in patristical theology. Boniface has been
fiercely denounced for his strong Roman principles,
and for his firm adherence to the interests of the
pope.<a name="FNanchor_271_271" id="FNanchor_271_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_271" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> Of his theological errors, or his faults as a
church disciplinarian, I have nothing here to do,
but leave that delicate question to the ecclesiastical
historian, having vindicated his character from the
charge of ignorance, and displayed some pleasing
traits which he evinced as a student and book-collector.
It only remains to be mentioned, that
many of the membranous treasures, which Boniface
had so eagerly searched for and collected from all
parts, were nearly lost forever. The pagans, who
murdered Boniface and his fellow-monks, on entering
their tents, discovered little to gratify their
avarice, save a few relics and a number of books,
which, with a barbarism corresponding with their
ignorance, they threw into the river as useless; but
fortunately, some of the monks, who had escaped
from their hands, observing the transaction, recovered
them and carried them away in safety with
the remains of the martyred missionary, who was
afterwards canonized Saint Boniface.</p>

<p>The must remarkable book collector contemporary
with Boniface, was Egbert of York, between<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173"></a>[<a href="./images/173.png">173</a>]</span>
whom, as we have seen, a bookish correspondence
was maintained. This illustrious prelate was
brother to King Egbert, of Northumbria, and
received his education under Bishop Eata, at Hexham,
about the year 686. He afterwards went on
a visit to the Apostolic See, and on his return was
made Archbishop of York.<a name="FNanchor_272_272" id="FNanchor_272_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_272" class="fnanchor">[272]</a> He probably collected
at Rome many of the fine volumes which
comprised his library, and which was so celebrated
in those old Saxon days; and which will be ever
renowned in the annals of ancient bibliomania. The
immortal Alcuin sang the praises of this library in
a tedious lay; and what glorious tomes of antiquity
he there enumerates! But stay, my pen should
tarry whilst I introduce that worthy bibliomaniac
to my reader, and relate some necessary anecdotes
and facts connected with his early life and times.</p>

<p>Alcuin was born in England, and probably in
the immediate vicinity of York; he was descended
from affluent and noble parents; but history is
especially barren on this subject, and we have no
information to instruct us respecting the antiquity
of his Saxon ancestry. But if obscurity hangs
around his birth, so soon as he steps into the paths
of learning and ranks with the students of his day,
we are no longer in doubt or perplexity; but are
able from that period to his death to trace the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174"></a>[<a href="./images/174.png">174</a>]</span>
occurrences of his life with all the ease that a
searcher of monkish history can expect. He had
the good fortune to receive his education from
Egbert, and under his care he soon became
initiated into the mysteries of grammar, rhetoric,
and jurisprudence; which were relieved by the
more fascinating study of poetry, physics, and
astronomy.<a name="FNanchor_273_273" id="FNanchor_273_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_273" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> So much was he esteemed by his
master the archbishop, that he entrusted him with
a mission to Rome, to receive from the hands of
the Pope his pall; on his return he called at Parma,
where he had an interview with Charles the Great;
who was so captivated with his eloquence and erudition
that he eagerly entreated him to remain, and to
aid in diffusing throughout his kingdom the spirit
of that knowledge which he had so successfully acquired
in the Saxon monasteries. But Alcuin was
equally anxious for the advancement of literature
in his own country; and being then on a mission
connected with his church, he could do no more
than hold out a promise of consulting his superiors,
to whose decisions he considered himself bound to
submit.</p>

<p>During the dominion of Charles, the ecclesiastical
as well as the political institutions of
France, were severely agitated by heresy and war:
the two great questions of the age&mdash;the Worship
of Images and the Nature of Christ&mdash;divided and
perplexed the members of a church which had
hitherto been permitted to slumber in peace and
quietude. The most prominent of the heretics
was Felix, Bishop of Urgel, who maintained in a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175"></a>[<a href="./images/175.png">175</a>]</span>
letter to Elipand, Bishop of Toledo, that Christ
was only the Son of God by adoption. It was
about the time of the convocation of the Council
of Frankfort, assembled to consider this point, that
Alcuin returned to France at the earnest solicitation
of Charlemagne. When the business of the
council was terminated, and peace was somewhat
restored, Alcuin began to think of returning to his
native country; but England at that time was a
land of bloodshed and tribulation, in the midst of
which it would be vain to hope for retirement or
the blessings of study; after some deliberation,
therefore, Alcuin resolved to remain in France,
where there was at least a wide field for exertion
and usefulness. He communicates his intention in
a letter to Offa, King of Mercia. "I was prepared,"
says he, "to come to you with the presents of King
Charles, and to return to my country; but it seemed
more advisable to me for the peace of my nation to
remain abroad; not knowing what I could have
done among those persons with whom no man can
be secure or able to proceed in any laudable
pursuit. See every holy place laid desolate by
pagans, the altars polluted by perjury, the monasteries
dishonored by adultery, the earth itself
stained with the blood of rulers and of princes."<a name="FNanchor_274_274" id="FNanchor_274_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_274" class="fnanchor">[274]</a></p>

<p>After the elapse of many years spent in the
brilliant court of Charles, during which time it surpassed
in literary greatness any epoch that preceded
it, he was permitted to seek retirement within the
walls of the abbey of St. Martin's at Tours. But<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176"></a>[<a href="./images/176.png">176</a>]</span>
in escaping from the bustle and intrigue of public
life he did not allow his days to pass away in an
inglorious obscurity; but sought to complete his
earthly career by inspiring the rising generation
with an honorable and christian ambition. His
cloistered solitude, far from weakening, seems to
have augmented the fertility of his genius, for it
was in the quiet seclusion of this monastery that
Alcuin composed the principal portion of his
works; nor are these writings an accumulation of
monastic trash, but the fruits of many a solitary
hour spent in studious meditation. His method is
perhaps fantastic and unnatural; but his style is
lively, and often elegant. His numerous quotations
and references give weight and interest to
his writings, and clearly proves what a fine old
library was at his command, and how well he knew
the use of it. But for the elucidation of his character
as a student, or a bibliomaniac, we naturally
turn to the huge mass of his epistles which have
been preserved; and in them we find a constant
reference to books which shew his intimacy with
the classics as well as the patristical lore of the
church. In biblical literature he doubtless possessed
many a choice and venerable tome; for an
indefatigable scripture reader was that great man.
In a curious little work of his called "<i>Interrogationes
et Responsiones sui Liber Questionorum in
Genesim</i>," we find an illustration of his usefulness
in spreading the knowledge he had gained in this
department of learning. It was written expressly
for his pupil and dearest brother (<i>carissime frater</i>),
Sigulf, as we learn from a letter which accompanies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177"></a>[<a href="./images/177.png">177</a>]</span>
it. He tells him that he had composed it "that he
might always have near him the means of refreshing
his memory when the more ponderous volumes of
the sacred Scriptures were not at his immediate
call."<a name="FNanchor_275_275" id="FNanchor_275_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_275" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> Perhaps of all his works this is the least
deserving of our praise; the good old monk was
apt to be prolix, if not tedious, when he found the
<i>stylus</i> in his hand and a clean skin of parchment
spread invitingly before him. But as this work was
intended as a manual to be consulted at any time,
he was compelled to curb this propensity, and to
reduce his explications to a few concise sentences.
Writing under this restraint, we find little bearing
the stamp of originality, not because he had nothing
original to say, but because he had not space to
write it in; I think it necessary to give this explanation,
as some critics upon the learning of that
remote age select these small and ill-digested writings
as fair specimens of the literary capacity of the
time, without considering why they were written or
compiled at all. But as a scribe how shall we
sufficiently praise that great man when we take
into consideration the fine Bible which he executed
for Charlemagne, and which is now fortunately
preserved in the British Museum. It is a superb
copy of St. Jerome's Latin version, freed from the
inaccuracies of the scribes; he commenced it about
the year 778, and did not complete it till the year
800, a circumstance which indicates the great care
he bestowed upon it. When finished he sent it to
Rome by his friend and disciple, Nathaniel, who
presented it to Charlemagne on the day of his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178"></a>[<a href="./images/178.png">178</a>]</span>
coronation: it was preserved by that illustrious
monarch to the last day of his life. Alcuin makes
frequent mention of this work being in progress,
and speaks of the labor he was bestowing upon it.<a name="FNanchor_276_276" id="FNanchor_276_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_276" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
We, who blame the monks for the scarcity of the
Bible among them, fail to take into consideration
the immense labor attending the transcriptions of
so great a volume; plodding and patience were
necessary to complete it. The history of this
biblical gem is fraught with interest, and well
worth relating. It is supposed to have been given
to the monastery of Prum in Lorraine by Lothaire,
the grandson of Charlemagne, who became a monk
of that monastery. In the year 1576 this religious
house was dissolved, but the monks preserved the
manuscript, and carried it into Switzerland to the
abbey of Grandis Vallis, near Basle, where it
reposed till the year 1793, when, on the occupation
of the episcopal territory of Basle by the French,
all the property of the abbey was confiscated and
sold, and the MS. under consideration came into
the possession of M. Bennot, from whom, in 1822,
it was purchased by M. Speyr Passavant, who
brought it into general notice, and offered it for
sale to the French Government at the price of
60,000 francs; this they declined, and its proprietor
struck of nearly 20,000 francs from the amount;
still the sum was deemed exorbitant, and with all
their bibliomanical enthusiasm, the conservers of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179"></a>[<a href="./images/179.png">179</a>]</span>
the Royal Library allowed the treasure to escape.
M. Passavant subsequently brought it to England,
where it was submitted to the Duke of Sussex, still
without success. He also applied to the trustees
of the British Museum, and Sir F. Madden informs
us that "much correspondence took place; at first
he asked 12,000<i>l.</i> for it; then 8,000<i>l.</i>, and at last
6,500<i>l.</i>, which he declared an <i>immense sacrifice!!</i>
At length, finding he could not part with his MS.
on terms so absurd, he resolved to sell it if possible
by auction; and accordingly, on the 27th of April,
1836, the Bible was knocked down by Mr. Evans
for the sum of 1,500<i>l.</i>, but for the proprietor himself,
as there was not one real bidding for it. This
result having brought M. Speyr Passavant in some
measure to his senses, overtures were made to him
on the part of the trustees to the British Museum,
and the manuscript finally became the property of
the nation, for the comparatively small sum of 750<i>l.</i>"
There can be no doubt as to the authenticity of
this precious volume, the verses of Alcuin's, found
in the manuscript, sufficiently prove it, for he alone
could write&mdash;</p>

<p>Often did Alcuin think of these goodly times with
a longing heart, and wish that he could revel
among them whilst in France. How deeply would
he have regretted, how many tears would he have
shed over the sad destruction of that fine library,
had he have known it; but his bones had mingled
with the dust when the Danes dispersed those rare
gems of ancient lore. If the reader should doubt
the ardor of Alcuin as a book-lover, let him read<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181"></a>[<a href="./images/181.png">181</a>]</span>
the following letter, addressed to Charlemagne,
which none but a bibliomaniac could pen.</p>

<p>"I, your Flaccus, according to your admonitions
and good-will, administer to some in the house of
St. Martin, the sweets of the Holy Scriptures,
<i>Sanctarum mella Scripturarum</i>: others I inebriate
with the study of ancient wisdom; and others I fill
with the fruits of grammatical lore. Many I seek
to instruct in the order of the stars which illuminate
the glorious vault of heaven; so that they may be
made ornaments to the holy church of God and the
court of your imperial majesty; that the goodness
of God and your kindness may not be altogether
unproductive of good. But in doing this I discover
the want of much, especially those exquisite books
of scholastic learning, which I possessed in my own
country, through the industry of my good and most
devout master (Egbert). I therefore intreat your
Excellence to permit me to send into Britain some
of our youths to procure those books which we so
much desire, and thus transplant into France the
flowers of Britain, that they may fructify and perfume,
not only the garden at York, but also the
Paradise of Tours; and that we may say, in the
words of the song, '<i>Let my beloved come into his
garden and eat his pleasant fruit</i>;' and to the
young, '<i>Eat, O friends; drink, yea, drink, abundantly,
O beloved</i>;' or exhort, in the words of the
prophet Isaiah, '<i>every one that thirsteth to come to
the waters, and ye that hath no money, come ye, buy
and eat: yea, come, buy wine and milk without
money and without price</i>.'</p>

<p>"Your Majesty is not ignorant how earnestly<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182"></a>[<a href="./images/182.png">182</a>]</span>
we are exhorted throughout the Holy Scriptures
to search after wisdom; nothing so tends to the
attainment of a happy life; nothing more delightful
or more powerful in resisting vice; nothing
more honorable to an exalted dignity; and, according
to philosophy, nothing more needful to
a just government of a people. Thus Solomon
exclaims, '<i>Wisdom is better than rubies, and all
the things that may be desired are not to be compared
to it</i>.' It exalteth the humble with sublime honors.
'<i>By wisdom kings reign and princes decree justice:
by me princes rule; and nobles, even all the judges
of the earth. Blessed are they that keep my ways,
and blessed is the man that heareth me.</i>' Continue,
then, my Lord King, to exhort the young in the
palaces of your highness to earnest pursuit in
acquiring wisdom; that they may be honored in
their old age, and ultimately enter into a blessed
immortality. I shall truly, according to my ability,
continue to sow in those parts the seeds of wisdom
among your servants; remembering the command,
'<i>In the morning sow thy seed, and in the evening
withhold not thine hand.</i>' In my youth I sowed
the seeds of learning in the prosperous seminaries
of Britain; and now, in my old age, I am doing so
in France without ceasing, praying that the grace
of God may bless them in both countries."<a name="FNanchor_278_278" id="FNanchor_278_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_278" class="fnanchor">[278]</a></p>

<p>Such was the enthusiasm, such the spirit of
bibliomania, which actuated the monks of those
<i>bookless</i> days; and which was fostered with such
zealous care by Alcuin, in the cloisters of St. Martin<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183"></a>[<a href="./images/183.png">183</a>]</span>
of Tours. He appropriated one of the apartments
of the monastery for the transcription of books, and
called it the <i>museum</i>, in which constantly were employed
a numerous body of industrious scribes: he
presided over them himself, and continually exhorted
them to diligence and care; to guard against the
inadvertencies of unskilful copyists, he wrote a
small work on orthography. We cannot estimate
the merits of this essay, for only a portion of it has
been preserved; but in the fragment printed among
his works, we can see much that might have been
useful to the scribes, and can believe that it must
have tended materially to preserve the purity of
ancient texts. It consists of a catalogue of words
closely resembling each other, and consequently
requiring the utmost care in transcribing.<a name="FNanchor_279_279" id="FNanchor_279_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_279" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>In these pleasing labors Alcuin was assisted by
many of the most learned men of the time, and
especially by Arno, Archbishop of Salzburgh, in
writing to whom Alcuin exclaims, "O that I could
suddenly translate my <i>Abacus</i>, and with my own
hands quickly embrace your fraternity with that
warmth which cannot be compressed in books.
Nevertheless, because I cannot conveniently come,
I send more frequently my unpolished letters (<i>rusticitatis
me&aelig; litteras</i>) to thee, that they may speak
for me instead of the words of my mouth." This
Arno, to whom he thus affectionately writes, was
no despicable scholar; he was a true lover of literature,
and proved himself something of an <i>amator</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184"></a>[<a href="./images/184.png">184</a>]</span>
<i>librorum</i>, by causing to be transcribed or bought
for his use, 150 volumes,<a name="FNanchor_280_280" id="FNanchor_280_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_280" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> but about this period
the bookloving mania spread far and wide&mdash;the
Emperor himself was touched with the enthusiasm;
for, besides his choice private collections,<a name="FNanchor_281_281" id="FNanchor_281_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_281" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> he
collected together the ponderous writings of the
holy fathers, amounting to upwards of 200 volumes,
bound in a most sumptuous manner, and commanded
them to be deposited in a public temple
and arranged in proper order, so that those who
could not purchase such treasures might be enabled
to feast on the lore of the ancients. Thus did
bibliomania flourish in the days of old.</p>

<p>But I must not be tempted to remain longer in
France, though the names of many choice old book
collectors would entice me to do so. When I left
England, to follow the steps of Alcuin, I was
speaking of York, which puts me in mind of the
monastery of Whitby,<a name="FNanchor_282_282" id="FNanchor_282_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_282" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> in the same shire, on the
banks of the river Eske. It was founded by Hilda,
the virgin daughter of Hereric, nephew to King
Edwin, about the year 680, who was its first abbess.
Having put her monastery in regular order, Hilda
set an illustrious example of piety and virtue, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185"></a>[<a href="./images/185.png">185</a>]</span>
particularly directed all under her care to a constant
reading of the holy Scriptures. After a long life
of usefulness and zeal she died deeply lamented by
the Saxon Church,<a name="FNanchor_283_283" id="FNanchor_283_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_283" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> an event which many powerful
miracles commemorated.</p>

<p>In the old times of the Saxons the monastery of
Whitby was renowned for its learning; and many
of the celebrated ecclesiastics of the day received
their instruction within its walls. The most interesting
literary anecdote connected with the good
lady Hilda's abbacy, is the kind reception she gave
to the Saxon poet C&aelig;dmon, whose paraphrase of
the Book of Genesis has rendered his name immortal.
He was wont to make "pious and religious
verses, so that whatever was interpreted to him out
of Scripture, he soon after put the same into poetical
expression of much sweetness and humility in English,
which was his native language. By his verses
the minds of many were often excited to despise
the world and to aspire to heaven. Others after
him attempted in the English nation to compose
religious poems, but none could ever compare with
him, <i>for he did not learn the art of poetry from
man but from God</i>."<a name="FNanchor_284_284" id="FNanchor_284_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_284" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> He was indeed, as the
venerable Bede says, a poet of nature's own teaching:
originally a rustic herdsman, the sublime gift
was bestowed upon him by inspiration, or as it is recorded,
in a dream. As he slept an unknown being
appeared, and commanded him to sing. C&aelig;dmon
hesitated to make the attempt, but the apparition
retorted, "Nevertheless, thou shalt sing&mdash;sing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186"></a>[<a href="./images/186.png">186</a>]</span>
the origin of things." Astonished and perplexed,
our poet found himself instantaneously in possession
of the pleasing art; and, when he awoke, his
vision and the words of his song were so impressed
upon his memory, that he easily repeated them to
his wondering companions.<a name="FNanchor_285_285" id="FNanchor_285_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_285" class="fnanchor">[285]</a> He hastened at day-break
to relate these marvels and to display his
new found talents to the monks of Whitby, by
whom he was joyfully received, and as they unfolded
the divine mysteries, "The good man," says
Bede, "listened like a clean animal ruminating; and
his song and his verse were so winsome to hear,
that his teachers wrote them down, and learned
from his mouth."<a name="FNanchor_286_286" id="FNanchor_286_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_286" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<p>Some contend that an ancient manuscript in the
British Museum is the original of this celebrated
paraphrase.<a name="FNanchor_287_287" id="FNanchor_287_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_287" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> It is just one of those choice relics
which a bibliomaniac loves to handle, but scarcely
perhaps bears evidence of antiquity so remote. It
is described in the catalogue as, "The substance of
the Book of Genesis, with the Acts of Moses and
Joshua, with brief notes and annotations, part in
Latin and part in Saxon by Bede and others."
The notes, if by Bede, would tend to favor the
opinion that it is the original manuscript, or, at
any rate, coeval with the Saxon bard. The volume,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187"></a>[<a href="./images/187.png">187</a>]</span>
as a specimen of calligraphic art, reflects honor
upon the age, and is right worthy of Lady Hilda's
monastery. There are 312<a name="FNanchor_288_288" id="FNanchor_288_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_288" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> fine velum pages in
this venerable and precious volume, nearly every
one of which dazzles with the talent of the skilful
illuminator. The initial letters are formed, with
singular taste and ingenuity, of birds, beasts, and
flowers. To give an idea of the nature of these pictorial
embellishments&mdash;which display more splendor
of coloring than accuracy of design&mdash;I may describe
the singular illumination adorning the sixth page,
which represents the birth of Eve. Adam is asleep,
reclining on the grass, which is depicted as so many
inverted cones; and, if we may judge from the
appearance of our venerable forefather, he could
not have enjoyed a very comfortable repose on that
memorable occasion, and the grass which grew in
the Garden of Paradise must have been of a very
stubborn nature when compared with the earth's
verdure of the present day; for the weight of
Adam alters not the position of the tender herb,
which supports his huge body on their extreme
summits. As he is lying on the left side Eve is
ascending from a circular aperture in his right; nor
would the original, if she bore any resemblance to
her monkish portraiture, excite the envy or the
admiration of the present age, or bear comparison
with her fair posterity. Her physiognomy is anything
but fascinating, and her figure is a repulsive
monstrosity, <i>adorned</i> with a profusion of luxurious
hair of a brilliant blue!</p>

<p>It is foreign to our subject to enter into any<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188"></a>[<a href="./images/188.png">188</a>]</span>
analysis of the literary beauties of this poem; let
it suffice that C&aelig;dmon, the old Saxon herdsman,
has been compared to our immortal Milton; and
their names have been coupled together when
speaking of a poet's genius.<a name="FNanchor_289_289" id="FNanchor_289_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_289" class="fnanchor">[289]</a> But on other grounds
C&aelig;dmon claims a full measure of our praise. Not
only was he the "Father of Saxon poetry," but to
him also belongs the inestimable honor of being
the first who attempted to render into the vulgar
tongue the beauties and mysteries of the Holy
Scriptures; he unsealed what had hitherto been a
sealed book; his paraphrase is the first translation
of the holy writ on record. So let it not be forgotten
that to this Milton of old our Saxon ancestors
were indebted for this invaluable treasure. We are
unable to trace distinctly the formation of the
monastic library of Whitby. But of the time of
Richard, elected abbot in the year 1148, a good
monk, and formerly prior of Peterborough, we
have a catalogue of their books preserved. I would<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189"></a>[<a href="./images/189.png">189</a>]</span>
refer the reader to that curious list,<a name="FNanchor_290_290" id="FNanchor_290_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_290" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> and ask him
if it does not manifest by its contents the existence
of a more refined taste in the cloisters than he gave
the old monks credit for. It is true, the legends of
saints abound in it; but then look at the choice
tomes of a classic age, whose names grace that
humble catalogue, and remember that the studies
of the Whitby monks were divided between the
miraculous lives of holy men, and the more pleasing
pages of the "Pagan Homer," the eloquence of
Tully, and the wit of Juvenal, of whose subject
they seemed to have been fond; for they read also
the satires of Persius. I extract the names of some
of the authors contained in this monkish library:</p>

<ul><li>Ambrose.</li>
<li>Hugo.</li>
<li>Theodolus.</li>
<li>Aratores.</li>

<p>Come, the monks evidently read something
besides their <i>Credo</i>, and transcribed something better
than "monastic trash." A little taste for literature
and learning we must allow they enjoyed,
when they formed their library of such volumes as
the above. I candidly admit, that when I commenced
these researches I had no expectations of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190"></a>[<a href="./images/190.png">190</a>]</span>
finding a collection of a hundred volumes, embracing
so many choice works of old Greece and
Rome. It is pleasant, however, to trace these
workings of bibliomania in the monasteries; and
it is a surprise quite agreeable and delicious in
itself to meet with instances like the present.</p>

<p>At a latter period the monastery of Rievall, in
Yorkshire, possessed an excellent library of 200
volumes. This we know by a catalogue of them,
compiled by one of the monks about the middle of
the fourteenth century, and now preserved in the
library of Jesus College, Cambridge.<a name="FNanchor_291_291" id="FNanchor_291_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_291" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> A transcript
of this manuscript was made by Mr. Halliwell, and
published in his "Reliqua Antiqua,"<a name="FNanchor_292_292" id="FNanchor_292_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_292" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> from which
it may be seen that the Rievall monastery contained
at that time many choice and valuable works. The
numerous writings of Sts. Augustine, Bernard, Anselm,
Cyprian, Origin, Haimo, Gregory, Ambrose,
Isidore, Chrysostom, Bede, Aldhelm, Gregory Nazienzen,
Ailred, Josephus, Rabanus Maurus, Peter
Lombard, Orosius, Boethius, Justin, Seneca, with
histories of the church of Britain, of Jerusalem, of
King Henry, and many others equally interesting
and costly, prove how industriously they used their
pens, and how much they appreciated literature and
learning. But in the fourteenth century the inhabitants
of the monasteries were very industrious
in transcribing books at a period coeval with the
compilation of the Rievall catalogue, a monk of
Coventry church was plying his pen with unceasing
energy; John de Bruges wrote with his own hand<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191"></a>[<a href="./images/191.png">191</a>]</span>
thirty-two volumes for the library of the benedictine
priory of St. Mary.</p>

<p>The reader will see that there is little among
them worthy of much observation. The MS.
begins, "These are the books which John of
Bruges, monk of Coventry, wrote for the Coventry
church. Any who shall take them away from the
church without the consent of the convent, let him
be anathema."<a name="FNanchor_293_293" id="FNanchor_293_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_293" class="fnanchor">[293]</a></p>

<p>The priory of St. Mary's was founded by
Leofricke, the celebrated Earl of Mercia and his
good Lady Godiva, in the year 1042. "Hollingshead
says that this Earl Leofricke was a man of
great honor, wise, and discreet in all his doings.
His high wisdome and policie stood the realme in
great steed whilst he lived.... He had a noble ladie
to his wife named Gudwina, at whose earnest sute
he made the citie of Couentrie free of all manner
of toll except horsses, and to haue that toll laid
downe also, his foresaid wife rode naked through
the middest of the towne without other couerture,
saue onlie her haire. Moreouer partlie moued by
his owne deuotion and partlie by the persuasion of
his wife, he builded or beneficiallie augmented and
repared manie abbeies and churches as the saide
abbie or priorie at Couentrie&mdash;the abbeies of
Wenlocke, Worcester, Stone, Evesham, and Leot,
besides Hereford."</p>

<p>The church of Worcester, which the good Earl
had thus "beneficiallie augmented," the Saxon King
Offa had endowed with princely munificence before
him. In the year 780, during the time of Abbot
Tilhere, or Gilhere, Offa gave to the church
Croppethorne, Netherton, Elmlege Cuddeshe,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193"></a>[<a href="./images/193.png">193</a>]</span>
Cherton, and other lands, besides a "large Bible
with two clasps, made of the purest gold."<a name="FNanchor_294_294" id="FNanchor_294_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_294" class="fnanchor">[294]</a> In the
tenth century the library of Exeter Church was
sufficiently extensive to require the preserving care
of an amanuensis; for according to Dr. Thomas,
Bishop Oswald granted in the year 985 three hides
of land at Bredicot, one yardland at Ginenofra, and
seven acres of meadow at Tiberton, to Godinge a
monk, on condition of his fulfilling the duties of a
librarian to the see, and transcribing the registers
and writings of the church. It is said that the
scribe Godinge wrote many choice books for the
library.<a name="FNanchor_295_295" id="FNanchor_295_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_295" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> I do not find any remarkable book
donation, save now and then a volume or two, in
the annals of Worcester Church; nor have I been
able to discover any old parchment catalogue to
tell of the number or rarity of their books; for
although probably most monasteries had one
compiled, being enjoined to do so by the regulations
of their order, they have long ago been destroyed;
for when we know that fine old manuscripts
were used by the bookbinders after the
Reformation, we can easily imagine how little value
would be placed on a mere catalogue of names.</p>

<p>But to return again to Godiva, that illustrious<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194"></a>[<a href="./images/194.png">194</a>]</span>
lady gave the monks, after the death of her lord,
many landed possessions, and bestowed upon them
the blessings of a library.<a name="FNanchor_296_296" id="FNanchor_296_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_296" class="fnanchor">[296]</a></p>

<p>Thomas Cobham, who was consecrated Bishop
of Worcester in the year 1317, was a great
"<i>amator librorum</i>," and spent much time and
money in collecting books. He was the first who
projected the establishment of a public library at
Oxford, which he designed to form over the old
Congregation House in the churchyard of St.
Mary's, but dying soon after in the year 1327, the
project was forgotten till about forty years after,
when I suppose the example of the great bibliomaniac
Richard de Bury drew attention to the
matter; for his book treasures were then "deposited
there, and the scholars permitted to consult them
on certain conditions."<a name="FNanchor_297_297" id="FNanchor_297_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_297" class="fnanchor">[297]</a></p>

<p>Bishop Carpenter built a library for the use of
the monastery of Exeter Church, in the year 1461,
over the charnal house; and endowed it with &pound;10
per annum as a salary for an amanuensis.<a name="FNanchor_298_298" id="FNanchor_298_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_298" class="fnanchor">[298]</a> But
the books deposited there were grievously destroyed
during the civil wars; for on the twenty-fourth of
September, 1642, when the army under the Earl of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195"></a>[<a href="./images/195.png">195</a>]</span>
Essex came to Worcester, they set about "destroying
the organ, breaking in pieces divers beautiful
windows, wherein the foundation of the church
was lively historified with painted glass;" they also
"rifled the library, with the records and evidences
of the church, tore in pieces the Bibles and service
books pertaining to the quire."<a name="FNanchor_299_299" id="FNanchor_299_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_299" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> Sad desecration of
ancient literature! But the reader of history will
sigh over many such examples.</p>

<p>The registers of Evesham Monastery, near
Worcester, speak of several monkish bibliophiles,
and the bookish anecdotes relating to them are
sufficiently interesting to demand some attention
here. Ailward, who was abbot in the year 1014,
gave the convent many relics and ornaments, and
what was still better a quantity of books.<a name="FNanchor_300_300" id="FNanchor_300_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_300" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> He was
afterwards promoted to the see of London, over
which he presided many years; but age and infirmity
growing upon him, he was anxious again to
retire to Evesham, but the monks from some cause
or other were unwilling to receive him back; at
this he took offence, and seeking in the monastery
of Ramsey the quietude denied him there, he demanded
back all the books he had given them.<a name="FNanchor_301_301" id="FNanchor_301_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_301" class="fnanchor">[301]</a>
His successor Mannius was celebrated for his skill
in the fine arts, and was an exquisite worker in
metals, besides an ingenious scribe and illuminator.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196"></a>[<a href="./images/196.png">196</a>]</span>
He wrote and illuminated with his own hand, for
the use of his monastery, a missal and a large
Psalter.<a name="FNanchor_302_302" id="FNanchor_302_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_302" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Walter, who was abbot in the year 1077, gave
also many books to the library,<a name="FNanchor_303_303" id="FNanchor_303_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_303" class="fnanchor">[303]</a> and among the
catalogue of sumptuous treasures with which Reginald,
a succeeding abbot, enriched the convent, a
great textus or gospels, with a multitude of other
books, <i>multa alia libros</i>, are particularly specified.<a name="FNanchor_304_304" id="FNanchor_304_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_304" class="fnanchor">[304]</a>
Almost equally liberal were the choice gifts bestowed
upon the monks by Adam (elected <span class="smcap">a. d.</span>
1161); but we find but little in our way among
them, except a fine copy of the "Old and New
Testament with a gloss." No mean gift I ween in
those old days; but one which amply compensated
for the deficiency of the donation in point of numbers.
But all these were greatly surpassed by a
monk whom it will be my duty now to introduce;
and to an account of whose life and bibliomanical
propensities, I shall devote a page or two. Like
many who spread a lustre around the little sphere
of their own, and did honor, humbly and quietly to
the sanctuary of the church in those Gothic days,
he is unknown to many; and might, perhaps, have
been entirely forgotten, had not time kindly spared
a document which testifies to his piety and book-collecting
industry. The reader will probably recollect
many who, by their shining piety and spotless
life, maintained the purity of the Christian faith in
a church surrounded by danger and ignorance, and
many a bright name, renowned for their virtue or<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197"></a>[<a href="./images/197.png">197</a>]</span>
their glory of arms, who flourished during the early
part of the thirteenth century; but few have heard
of a good and humble monk named Thomas of
Marleberg. Had circumstances designed him for a
higher sphere, had affairs of state, or weighty duties
of an ecclesiastical import, been guided by his hand,
his name would have been recorded with all the
flourish of monkish adulation; but the learning and
the prudence of that lowly monk was confined to
the little world of Evesham; and when his earthly
manes were buried beneath the cloisters within the
old convent walls, his name and good deeds were
forgotten by the world, save in the hearts of his
fraternity.</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"But past is all his fame. The very spot<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">Where many a time he triumph'd, is forgot."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In a manuscript in the Cotton Library there is
a document called "The good deeds of Prior
Thomas," from which the following facts have
been extracted.<a name="FNanchor_305_305" id="FNanchor_305_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_305" class="fnanchor">[305]</a></p>

<p>From this interesting memorial of his labors,
we learn that Thomas had acquired some repute
among the monks for his great knowledge of civil
and canon law; so that when any difficulty arose
respecting the claims or privileges of the monastery,
or when any important matter was to be transacted,
his advice was sought and received with deference
and respect. Thus three years after his admission
the bishop of Worcester intimated his intention of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198"></a>[<a href="./images/198.png">198</a>]</span>
paying the monastery a visitation; a practice which
the bishops of that see had not enforced since the
days of abbot Alurie. The abbot and convent
however considered themselves free from the jurisdiction
of the bishop; and acting on the advice of
Thomas of Marleberg, they successfully repulsed
him. The affair was quite an event, and seems to
have caused much sensation among them at the
time; and is mentioned to show with what esteem
Thomas was regarded by his monkish brethren.
After a long enumeration of "good works" and
important benefactions, such as rebuilding the tower
and repairing the convent, we are told that "In the
second year of Randulp's abbacy, Thomas, then
dean, went with him to Rome to a general council,
where, by his prudence and advice, a new arrangement
in the business of the convent rents was confirmed,
and many other useful matters settled."
Here I am tempted to refer to the <i>arrangements</i>,
for they offer pleasing illustrations of the monk as
an "<i>amator librorum</i>." Mark how his thoughts
dwelt&mdash;even when surrounded by those high dignitaries
of the church, and in the midst of that important
council&mdash;on the library and the scriptorium
of his monastery.</p>

<p>Pleasing traits are these of his bookloving passion;
and doubtless under his guidance the convent
library grew and flourished amazingly. But let us
return to the account of his "good works."</p>

<p>"Returning from Rome after two years he was
elected sacrist. He then made a reading-desk
behind the choir,<a name="FNanchor_307_307" id="FNanchor_307_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_307" class="fnanchor">[307]</a> which was much wanted in the
church, and appointed stated readings to be held
near the tomb of Saint Wilsius.... Leaving his
office thus rich in good works, he was then elected
prior. In this office he buried his predecessor,
Prior John, in a new mausoleum; and also John,
surnamed Dionysius; of the latter of whom Prior
Thomas was accustomed to say, 'that he had never
known any man who so perfectly performed every
kind of penance as he did for more than thirty
years, in fasting and in prayer; in tears and in
watchings; in cold and in corporeal inflictions; in
coarseness and roughness of clothing, and in denying
himself bodily comforts, far more than any other of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200"></a>[<a href="./images/200.png">200</a>]</span>
the brethren; all of which he rather dedicated in
good purposes and to the support of the poor."</p>

<p>Thus did many an old monk live, practising all
this with punctilious care as the essence of a holy
life, and resting upon the fallacy that these cruel
mortifyings of the flesh would greatly facilitate the
acquisition of everlasting ease and joy in a better
world; as if God knew not, better than themselves,
what chastisements and afflictions were needful for
them. We may sigh with pain over such instances
of mistaken piety and fanatical zeal in all ages of
the church; yet with all their privations, and with
all their macerations of the flesh, there was a vast
amount of human pride mingled with their humiliation.
But He who sees into the hearts of all&mdash;looking
in his benevolence more at the intention
than the outward form, may perhaps sometimes
find in it the workings of a true christian piety, and
so reward it with his love. Let us trust so in the
charity of our faith, and proceed to notice that portion
of the old record which is more intimately
connected with our subject. We read that</p>

<p>"Thomas had brought with him to the convent,
on his entering, many books, of both canon and
civil law; as well as the books by which he had
regulated the schools of Oxford and Exeter before
he became a monk. He likewise had one book of
Democritus; and the book of Antiparalenion, a
gradual book, according to Constantine; Isidore's
Divine Offices, and the Quadrimum of Isidore;
Tully's de Amicitia; Tully de Senectute et de
Paradoxis; Lucan, Juvenal, and many other authors,
<i>et multos alios auctores</i>, with a great number of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201"></a>[<a href="./images/201.png">201</a>]</span>
sermons, with many writings on theological questions;
on the art and rules of grammar and the
book of accents. After he was prior he made a
great breviary, better than any at that time in the
monastery, with Haimo, on the Apocalypse, and a
book containing the lives of the patrons of the
church of Evesham; with an account of the deeds
of all the good and bad monks belonging to the
church, in one volume. He also wrote and bound
up the same lives and acts in another volume
separately. He made also a great Psalter, <i>magnum
psalterium</i>, superior to any contained in the monastery,
except the glossed ones. He collected and
wrote all the necessary materials for four antiphoners,
with their musical notes, himself; except
what the brothers of the monastery transcribed for
him. He also finished many books that William
of Lith, of pious memory, commenced&mdash;the Marterologium,
the Exceptio Miss&aelig;, and some excellent
commentaries on the Psalter and Communion
of the Saints in the old antiphoners. He also
bought the four Gospels, with glosses, and Isaiah
and Ezekiel, also glossed;<a name="FNanchor_308_308" id="FNanchor_308_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_308" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> the Pistill&aelig; upon Matthew;
some Allegories on the Old Testament; the
Lamentations of Jeremiah, with a gloss; the Exposition
of the Mass, according to Pope Innocent;
and the great book of Alexander Necham, which is
called <i>Corrogationes Promethea de partibus veteris
testamenti et nov&aelig;</i>.... He also caused to be transcribed
in large letters the book concerning the
offices of the abbey, from the Purification of St.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202"></a>[<a href="./images/202.png">202</a>]</span>
Mary to the Feast of Easter; the prelections respecting
Easter; Pentecost, and the blessings at the
baptismal fonts. He also caused a volume, containing
the same works, to be transcribed, but in a
smaller hand; all of which the convent had not
before. He made also the tablet for the locutory
in the chapel of St. Anne, towards the west. After
the altar of St. Mary in the crypts had been despoiled
by thieves of its books and ornaments, to
the value of ten pounds, he contributed to their
restoration."</p>

<p>Thomas was equally liberal in other matters.
His whole time and wealth were spent in rebuilding
and repairing the monastery and adding to its
comforts and splendor. He had a great veneration
for antiquity, and was especially anxious to restore
those parts which were dilapidated by time;
the old inscriptions on the monuments and altars
he carefully re-inscribed. It is recorded that he renewed
the inscription on the great altar himself,
without the aid of a book, <i>sine libro</i>; which was
deemed a mark of profound learning in my lord
abbot by his monkish surbordinates.</p>

<p>With this I conclude my remarks on Thomas
of Marleberg, leaving these extracts to speak for
him. It is pleasing to find that virtue so great,
and industry so useful met with its just reward; and
that the monks of Evesham proved how much they
appreciated such talents, by electing him their abbot,
in 1229, which, for seven years he held with
becoming piety and wisdom.</p>

<p>The annals of the monastery<a name="FNanchor_309_309" id="FNanchor_309_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_309" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> testify that "In<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203"></a>[<a href="./images/203.png">203</a>]</span>
the year of our Lord one thousand three hundred
and ninety-two, and the fifteenth of the reign of
King Richard the Second, on the tenth calends of
May, died the venerable Prior Nicholas Hereford,
of pious memory, who, as prior of the church of
Evesham, lived a devout and religious life for
forty years." He held that office under three succeeding
abbots, and filled it with great honor and
industry. He was a dear lover of books, and spent
vast sums in collecting together his private library,
amounting to more than 100 volumes; some of
these he wrote with his own hand, but most of
them he bought <i>emit</i>. A list of these books is
given in the Harleian Register, and many of the
volumes are described as containing a number of
tracts, bound up in one, <i>cum aliis tractatibus in
eodem volumine</i>. Some of these display the industry
of his pen, and silently tell us of his Christian
piety. Among those remarkable for their bulk, it
is pleasurable to observe a copy of the Holy Scriptures,
which was doubtless a comfort to the venerable
prior in the last days of his green old age;
and which probably guided him in the even tenor
of that <i>devout and religious life</i>, for which he was
so esteemed by the monks of Evesham. He possessed
also some works of Bernard Augustin, and
Boethius, whose Consolation of Philosophy few
book-collectors of the middle ages were without.
To many of the books the prices he gave for them,
or at which they were then valued, are affixed: a
"<i>Summa Pr&aelig;dicantium</i>" is valued at eight marks,
and a "<i>Burley super Politices</i>" at seven marks. We
may suspect monk Nicholas of being rather a curi<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204"></a>[<a href="./images/204.png">204</a>]</span>ous
collector in his way, for we find in his library
some interesting volumes of popular literature.
He probably found much pleasure in perusing his
copy of the marvelous tale of "Beufys of Hampton,"
and the romantic "Mort d'Arthur," both
sufficiently interesting to relieve the monotonous
vigils of the monastery. But I must not dwell
longer on the monastic bibliophiles of Evesham,
other libraries and bookworms call for some notice
from my pen.</p>

a sweet spot for contemplation; surrounded by all that is lovely in
nature, it drives our old prejudices away, and touches the heart with

crumbling parapets, admiring the taste of those Cistercian monks in
choosing so quiet, romantic, and choice a spot, and one so well suited
to lead man's thoughts to sacred things above.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">he</span> fame of Glastonbury Abbey
will attract the steps of the
western traveller; and if he possess
the spirit of an antiquary, his
eye will long dwell on those mutilated
fragments of monkish architecture.
The bibliophile will
regard it with still greater love; for, in its day,
it was one of the most eminent repositories
of those treasures which it is his province to
collect. For more than ten hundred years that
old fabric has stood there, exciting in days of
remote antiquity the veneration of our pious
forefathers, and in modern times the admiration
of the curious. Pilgrim! tread lightly on that
hallowed ground! sacred to the memory of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206"></a>[<a href="./images/206.png">206</a>]</span>
most learned and illustrious of our Saxon ancestry.
The bones of princes and studious monks closely
mingle with the ruins which time has caused, and
bigotry helped to desecrate. Monkish tradition
claims, as the founder of Glastonbury Abbey, St.
Joseph of Arimathea, who, sixty-three years after
the incarnation of our Lord, came to spread the
truths of the Gospel over the island of Britain.
Let this be how it may, we leave it for more certain
data.</p></div>

<p>After, says a learned antiquary, its having been
built by St. Davis, Archbishop of Menevia, and
then again restored by "twelve well affected men
in the north;" it was entirely pulled down by Ina,
king of the West Saxons, who "new builded the
abbey of Glastonburie<a name="FNanchor_310_310" id="FNanchor_310_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_310" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> in a fenny place out of the
way, to the end the monks mought so much the
more give their mindes to heavenly thinges, and
chiefely use the contemplation meete for men of
such profession. This was the fourth building of
that monasterie."<a name="FNanchor_311_311" id="FNanchor_311_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_311" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> The king completed his good
work by erecting a beautiful chapel, garnished with
numerous ornaments and utensils of gold and
silver; and among other costly treasures, William
of Malmsbury tells us that twenty pounds and
sixty marks of gold was used in making a coopertoria
for a book of the Gospels.<a name="FNanchor_312_312" id="FNanchor_312_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_312" class="fnanchor">[312]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207"></a>[<a href="./images/207.png">207</a>]</span></p><p>Would that I had it in my power to write the
literary history of Glastonbury Abbey; to know
what the monks of old there transcribed would be
to acquire the history of learning in those times;
for there was little worth reading in the literature
of the day that was not copied by those industrious
scribes. But if our materials will not enable
us to do this, we may catch a glimpse of their well
stored shelves through the kindness and care of
William Britone the Librarian, who compiled a
work of the highest interest to the biographer. It
is no less than a catalogue of the books contained
in the common library of the abbey in the year
one thousand two hundred and forty-eight. Four
hundred choice volumes comprise this fine collection;<a name="FNanchor_313_313" id="FNanchor_313_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_313" class="fnanchor">[313]</a>
and will not the reader be surprised to find
among them a selection of the classics, with the
chronicles, poetry, and romantic productions of
the middle ages, besides an abundant store of the
theological writings of the primitive Church. But
I have not transcribed a large proportion of this
list, as the extracts given from other monastic catalogues
may serve to convey an idea of their nature;
but I cannot allow one circumstance connected
with this old document to pass without remark. I
would draw the reader's attention to the fine bibles
which commence the list, and which prove that the
monks of Glastonbury Abbey were fond and devoted
students of the Bible. It begins with&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Bibliotheca una in duobus voluminibus.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208"></a>[<a href="./images/208.png">208</a>]</span></li>

</ul>

<p>But besides these, the library contained numerous
detached books and many copies of the Gospels,
an ample collection of the fathers, and the controversal
writings of the middle ages; and among
many others, the following classics&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Aristotle.</li>
<li>Livy.</li>
<li>Orosius.</li>
<li>Sallust.</li>
<li>Donatus.</li>

<li>Prosper.</li>
<li>Aratores.</li>
<li>Claudian.</li>
<li>Juvenal.</li>
<li>Cornutus.</li>
</ul>

<p>I must not omit to mention that John de Taunton,
a monk and an enthusiastic <i>amator librorum</i>,
and who was elected abbot in the year 1271,
collected forty choice volumes, and gave them to
the library, <i>dedit librario</i>, of the abbey; no mean
gift, I ween, in the thirteenth century. They
included&mdash;</p>

</ul>

<p>Subsequent to this, in the time of one book-loving
abbot, an addition of forty-nine volumes was
made to the collection by his munificence and the
diligence of his scribes; and time has allowed the
modern bibliophile to gaze on a catalogue of these
treasures. I wish the monkish annalist had recorded
the life of this early bibliomaniac, but
unfortunately we know little of him. But they
were no mean nor paltry volumes that he transcribed.
It is with pleasure I see the catalogue
commenced by a copy of the Holy Scriptures; and
the many commentaries upon them by the fathers
of the church enumerated after it, prove my Lord
Abbot to have been a diligent student of the Bible.
Nor did he seek God alone in his written word;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210"></a>[<a href="./images/210.png">210</a>]</span>
but wisely understood that his Creator spoke to
him also by visible works; and probably loved to
observe the great wisdom and design of his God in
the animated world; for a Pliny's Natural History

<p>The reader, I think, will allow that the catalogue
enumerates but little unsuitable for a christian's
study; he may not admire the principles contained
in some of them, or the superstition with which
many of them are loaded; but after all there were
but few volumes among them from which a Bible
reading monk might not have gleaned something
good and profitable. These books were transcribed
about the end of the thirteenth century, after the
catalogue of the monastic library mentioned above
was compiled.</p>

<p>Walter Taunton, elected in the year 1322, gave
to the library several volumes; and his successor,
Adam Sodbury,<a name="FNanchor_317_317" id="FNanchor_317_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_317" class="fnanchor">[317]</a> elected in the same year, increased<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212"></a>[<a href="./images/212.png">212</a>]</span>
it with a copy of the whole Bible,<a name="FNanchor_318_318" id="FNanchor_318_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_318" class="fnanchor">[318]</a> a Scholastic
history, Lives of Saints, a work on the Properties
of Things, two costly Psalters, and a most beautifully
bound Benedictional.</p>

<p>But doubtless many a bookworm nameless in
the page of history, dwelled within those walls
apart from worldly solicitude and strife; relieving
what would otherwise have been an insupportable
monotony, with sweet converse, with books, or the
avocations of a scribe.</p>

<p>Well, years rolled on, and this fair sanctuary
remained in all its beauty, encouraging the trembling
christian, and fostering with a mother's care the
literature and learning of the time. Thus it stood
till that period, so dark and unpropitious for
monkish ascendency, when Protestant fury ran wild,
and destruction thundered upon the heads of those
poor old monks! A sad and cruel revenge for
enlightened minds to wreck on mistaken piety and
superstitious zeal. How widely was the fine library
scattered then. Even a few years after its dissolution,
when Leland spent some days exploring the
book treasures reposing there, it had been broken
up, and many of them lost; yet still it must have
been a noble library, for he tells us that it was
"scarcely equalled in all Britain;" and adds, in the
spirit of a true bibliomaniac, that he no sooner
passed the threshold than the very sight of so
many sacred remains of antiquity struck him with
awe and astonishment. The reader will naturally
wish that he had given us a list of what he found
there; but he merely enumerates a selection of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213"></a>[<a href="./images/213.png">213</a>]</span>
thirty-nine, among which we find a Grammatica
Eriticis, formerly belonging to Saint Dunstan; a
life of Saint Wilfrid; a Saxon version of Orosius,
and the writings of William of Malmsbury.<a name="FNanchor_319_319" id="FNanchor_319_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_319" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> The
antiquary will now search in vain for any vestige of
the abbey library; even the spot on which it stood
is unknown to the curious.</p>

<p>No christian, let his creed be what it may, who
has learnt from his master the principles of charity
and love, will refuse a tear to the memory of
Richard Whiting, the last of Glastonbury's abbots.
Poor old man! Surely those white locks and tottering
limbs ought to have melted a Christian
heart; but what charity or love dwelt within the
soul of that rapacious monarch? Too old to relinquish
his long cherished superstitions; too firm
to renounce his religious principles, Whiting offered
a firm opposition to the reformation. The fury of
the tyrant Henry was aroused, and that grey headed
monk was condemned to a barbarous death. As a
protestant I blush to write it, yet so it was; after a
hasty trial, if trial it can be called, he was dragged
on a hurdle to a common gallows erected on Torr
Hill, and there, in the face of a brutal mob, with
two of his companion monks, was he hung! Protestant
zeal stopped not here, for when life had
fled they cut his body down, and dividing it into
quarters, sent one to each of the four principal
towns; and as a last indignity to that mutilated
clay, stuck his head on the gate of the old abbey,
over which he had presided with judicious care in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214"></a>[<a href="./images/214.png">214</a>]</span>
the last days of his troubled life. It was Whiting's
wish to bid adieu in person to his monastery, in
which in more prosperous times he had spent many
a quiet hour; it is said that even this, the dying
prayer of that poor old man, they refused to
grant.<a name="FNanchor_320_320" id="FNanchor_320_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_320" class="fnanchor">[320]</a></p>

<p>On viewing the ruins of Glastonbury Abbey,
so mournful to look upon, yet so splendid in its
decay, we cannot help exclaiming with Michael
Dayton,&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"On whom for this sad waste, should justice lay the crime."</p></div>

<p>Whilst in the west we cannot pass unnoticed the
monastery of Malmsbury, one of the largest in
England, and which possessed at one time an
extensive and valuable library; but it was sadly
ransacked at the Reformation, and its vellum
treasures sold to the bakers to heat their stoves, or
applied to the vilest use; not even a catalogue was
preserved to tell the curious of a more enlightened
age, what books the old monks read there; but
perhaps, and the blood runs cold as the thought
arises in the mind, a perfect Livy was among them,
for a rare <i>amator librorum</i> belonging to this monastery,
quotes one of the lost Decades.<a name="FNanchor_321_321" id="FNanchor_321_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_321" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> I allude to
William of Malmsbury, one of the most enthusiastic
bibliomaniacs of his age. From his youth he dwelt
within the abbey walls, and received his education<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215"></a>[<a href="./images/215.png">215</a>]</span>
there. His constant study and indefatigable industry
in collecting and perusing books, was only
equalled by his prudence and by his talents; he
soon rose in the estimation of his fellow monks,
who appointed him their librarian, and ultimately
offered him the abbacy, which he refused with
Christian humility, fearing too, lest its contingent
duties would debar him from a full enjoyment of
his favorite avocation; but of his book passion let
William of Malmsbury speak for himself: "A long
period has elapsed since, as well through the care
of my parents as my own industry, I became familiar
with books. This pleasure possessed me from my
childhood; this source of delight has grown with
my years; indeed, I was so instructed by my father,
that had I turned aside to other pursuits, I should
have considered it as jeopardy to my soul, and discredit
to my character. Wherefore, mindful of the
adage, 'covet what is necessary,' I constrained my
early age to desire eagerly that which it was disgraceful
not to possess. I gave indeed my attention
to various branches of literature, but in different
degrees. Logic, for instance, which gives
arms to eloquence, I contented myself with barely
learning: medicine, which ministers to the health
of the body, I studied with somewhat more attention.
But now, having scrupulously examined the
various branches of ethics, I bow down to its
majesty, because it spontaneously inverts itself to
those who study it, and directs their minds to moral
practice, history more especially; which by a certain
agreeable recapitulation of past events, excites its
readers by example, to frame their lives to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216"></a>[<a href="./images/216.png">216</a>]</span>
pursuit of good or to aversion from evil. When,
therefore, at my own expense I had procured some
historians of foreign nations, I proceeded during
my domestic leisure, to inquire if anything concerning
our own country could be found worthy of
handing down to posterity. Hence it arose, that
not content with the writings of ancient times, I
began myself to compose, not indeed to display my
learning, which is comparatively nothing, but to
bring to light events lying concealed in the confused
mass of antiquity. In consequence, rejecting vague
opinions, I have studiously sought for chronicles far
and near, though I confess I have scarcely profited
anything by this industry; for perusing them all I
still remained poor in information, though I ceased
not my researches as long as I could find anything
to read."<a name="FNanchor_322_322" id="FNanchor_322_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_322" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<p>Having read this passage, I think my readers
will admit that William of Malmsbury well deserves
a place among the bibliomaniacs of the middle
ages. As an historian his merit is too generally
known and acknowledged to require an elucidation
here. He combines in most cases a strict attention
to fact, with the rare attributes of philosophic
reflection, and sometimes the bloom of eloquence.
But simplicity of narrative constitute the greatest
and sometimes the only charm in the composition
of the monkish chroniclers. William of Malmsbury
aimed at a more ambitious style, and attempted to
adorn, as he admits himself, his English history
with Roman art; this he does sometimes with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217"></a>[<a href="./images/217.png">217</a>]</span>
tolerable elegance, but too often at the cost of
necessary detail. Yet still we must place him at
the head of the middle age historians, for he was
diligent and critical, though perhaps not always
impartial; and in matters connected with Romish
doctrine, his testimony is not always to be relied
upon without additional authority; his account of
those who held opinions somewhat adverse to the
orthodoxy of Rome is often equivocal; we may
even suspect him of interpolating their writings, at
least of Alfric, whose homilies had excited the
fears of the Norman ecclesiastics. His works were
compiled from many sources now unknown; and
from the works of Bede, the Saxon chronicles, and
Florilegus, he occasionally transcribes with little
alteration.</p>

<p>But is it not distressing to find that this talented
author, so superior in other respects to the crude
compilers of monkish history, cannot rise above the
superstition of the age? Is it not deplorable that
a mind so gifted could rely with fanatical zeal upon
the verity of all those foul lies of Rome called
"Holy" miracles; or that he could conceive how
God would vouchsafe to make his saints ridiculous
in the eyes of man, by such gross absurdities as
tradition records, but which Rome deemed worthy
of canonization; but it was then, as now, so difficult
to conquer the prejudices of early teaching. With
all our philosophy and our science, great men cannot
do it now; even so in the days of old; they were
brought up in the midst of superstition; sucked it
as it were from their mother's breast, and fondly
cradled in its belief; and as soon as the infant mind<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218"></a>[<a href="./images/218.png">218</a>]</span>
could think, parental piety dedicated it to God;
not, however, as a light to shine before men, but as
a candle under a bushel; for to serve God and to
serve monachism were synonymous expressions in
those days.</p>

<p>The west of England was honored by many a
monkish bibliophile in the middle ages. The annals
of Gloucester abbey record the names of
several. Prior Peter, who became abbot in the
year 1104, is said to have enclosed the monastery
with a stone wall, and greatly enriched it with
many books "<i>copia librorum</i>."<a name="FNanchor_323_323" id="FNanchor_323_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_323" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> A few years after
(<span class="smcap">a. d.</span> 1113), <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'Godemon'">Godeman</ins> the Prior was made abbot,
and the Saxon Chronicle records that during his
time the tower was set on fire by lightning and the
whole monastery was burnt; so that all the valuable
things therein were destroyed except a "few books
and three priest's mass-hackles."<a name="FNanchor_324_324" id="FNanchor_324_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_324" class="fnanchor">[324]</a> Abbot Gamage
gave many books to the library in the year 1306;<a name="FNanchor_325_325" id="FNanchor_325_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_325" class="fnanchor">[325]</a>
and Richard de Stowe, during the same century,
gave the monks a small collection in nine or ten
volumes; a list of them is preserved in an old
manuscript.<a name="FNanchor_326_326" id="FNanchor_326_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_326" class="fnanchor">[326]</a></p>

<p>But earlier than this in the eleventh century, a
bishop of Exeter stands remarkable as an <i>amator
librorum</i>. Leofric, the last bishop of Crediton, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219"></a>[<a href="./images/219.png">219</a>]</span>
"sometime lord chancellor of England,"<a name="FNanchor_327_327" id="FNanchor_327_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_327" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> received
permission from Edward the Confessor to translate
the seat of his diocese to the city of Exeter in the
year 1050. "He was brought up and studied in
<i>Lotharingos</i>," says William of Malmsbury,<a name="FNanchor_328_328" id="FNanchor_328_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_328" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> and he
manifested his learning and fondness for study by
collecting books. Of the nature of his collections
we are enabled to judge by the volumes he gave to
the church of Exeter. The glimpse thus obtained
lead us to consider him a curious book-collector;
and it is so interesting to look upon a catalogue of
a bishop's private library in that early time, and to
behold his tastes and his pursuits reflected and
mirrored forth therein, that I am sure the reader
will be gratified by its perusal.<a name="FNanchor_329_329" id="FNanchor_329_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_329" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> After enumerating
some broad lands and a glittering array of sumptuous
ornaments, he is recorded to have given to
the church "Two complete mass books; 1 Collectarium;
2 Books of Epistles (<i>Pistel Bec</i><a name="FNanchor_330_330" id="FNanchor_330_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_330" class="fnanchor">[330]</a>); 2 complete
<i>Sang Bec</i>; 1 Book of <i>night sang</i>; 1 Book
<i>unus liber</i>, a Breviary or Tropery; 2 Psalters;
3 Psalters according to the Roman copies; 2 Antiphoners;
A precious book of blessings; 3 others;
1 Book of Christ <i>in English</i>; 2 Summer Reading
bec; 1 Winter ditto; Rules and Canons; 1 Martyrology;
1 Canons in Latin; 1 Confessional <i>in</i><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220"></a>[<a href="./images/220.png">220</a>]</span>
<i>English</i>; 1 Book of Homilies and Hymns for
Winter and Summer; 1 Boethius on the Consolation
of Philosophy, <i>in English</i> (King Alfred's
translation); 1 Great Book of Poetry in English;
1 Capitular; 1 Book of very ancient nocturnal
<i>sangs</i>; 1 Pistel bec; 2 Ancient r&aelig;ding bec; 1 for
the use of the priest; also the following books in
Latin, viz., 1 Pastoral of Gregory; 1 Dialogues of
Gregory; 1 Book of the Four Prophets; 1 Boethius
Consolation of Philosophy; 1 Book of the offices of
Amalar; 1 Isagoge of Porphyry; 1 Passional; 1 book
of Prosper; 1 book of Prudentius the Martyr; 1 Prudentius;
1 Prudentius (<i>de Mrib.</i>); 1 other book;
1 Ezechael the Prophet; 1 Isaiah the Prophet;
1 Song of Songs; 1 Isidore Etymology; 1 Isidore
on the New and Old Testament; 1 Lives of the
Apostles; 1 Works of Bede; 1 Bede on the Apocalypse;
1 Bede's Exposition on the Seven Canonical
Epistles; 1 book of Isidore on the Miracles
of Christ; 1 book of Orosius; 1 book of Machabees;
1 book of Persius; 1 Sedulus; 1 Avator; 1 book of
Statius with a gloss."</p>

<p>Such were the books forming a part of the private
library of a bishop of Exeter in the year of grace
1073. Few indeed when compared with the vast
multitudes assembled and amassed together in the
ages of printed literature. But these sixty or
seventy volumes, collected in those times of dearth,
and each produced by the tedious process of the
pen, were of an excessive value, and mark their
owner as distinctly an <i>amator librorum</i>, as the
enormous piles heaped together in modern times
would do a Magliabechi. Nor was Leofric an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221"></a>[<a href="./images/221.png">221</a>]</span>
ordinary collector; he loved to preserve the idiomatic
poetry of those old Saxon days; his ancient
<i>sang bec</i>, or song books, would now be deemed a
curious and precious relic of Saxon literature.
One of these has fortunately escaped the ravages
of time and the fate of war. "The great boc of
English Poetry" is still preserved at Exeter&mdash;one
of the finest relics of Anglo Saxon poetry extant.
Mark too those early translations which we cannot
but regard with infinite pleasure, and which satisfactorily
prove that the Gospels and Church Service
was at least partly read and sung in the Saxon
church in the common language of the people; let
the Roman Catholics say what they will.<a name="FNanchor_331_331" id="FNanchor_331_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_331" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> But
without saying much of his church books, we cannot
but be pleased to find the Christian Boethius in his
library with Bede, Gregory, Isidore, Prosper, Orosius,
Prudentius, Sedulus, Persius and Statius; these
are authors which retrieve the studies of Leofric
from the charge of mere monastic lore.</p>

<p>But good books about this time were beginning
to be sought after with avidity. The Cluniac
monks, who were introduced into England about
the year 1077, more than one hundred and sixty
years after their foundation, gave a powerful impetus
to monastic learning; which received additional
force by the enlightened efforts of the Cistercians,
instituted in 1098, and spread into Britain
about the year 1128. These two great branches<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222"></a>[<a href="./images/222.png">222</a>]</span>
of the Benedictine order, by their great love of
learning, and by their zeal in collecting books,
effected a great change in the monkish literature
of England. "They were not only curious and
attentive in forming numerous libraries, but with
indefatigable assiduity transcribed the volumes of
the ancients, <i>l'assiduit&eacute; infatigable &agrave; transcrire les
livres des anciens</i>, say the Benedictines of St.
Maur,<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_332_332" id="FNanchor_332_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_332" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> who perhaps however may be suspected of
regarding their ancient brethren in rather too favorable
a light. But certain it is, that the state of
literature became much improved, and the many
celebrated scholars who flourished in the twelfth
century spread a taste for reading far and wide, and
by their example caused the monks to look more
eagerly after books. Peter of Blois, Archdeacon
of London, is one of the most pleasing instances of
this period, and his writings have even now a freshness
and vivacity about them which surprise as they
interest the reader. This illustrious student, and
truly worthy man, was born at Blois in the early
part of the twelfth century. His parents, who were
wealthy and noble, were desirous of bestowing
upon their son an education befitting their own
rank; for this purpose he was sent to Paris to
receive instruction in the general branches of scholastic
knowledge. He paid particular attention to
poetry, and studied rhetoric with still greater
ardor.<a name="FNanchor_333_333" id="FNanchor_333_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_333" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> But being designed for the bar, he left
Paris for Bologna, there to study civil law; and
succeeded in mastering all the dry technicalities of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223"></a>[<a href="./images/223.png">223</a>]</span>
legal science. He then returned to Paris to study
scholastic divinity,<a name="FNanchor_334_334" id="FNanchor_334_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_334" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> in which he became eminently
proficient, and was ever excessively fond. He
remained at Paris studying deeply himself, and
instructing others for many years. About the year
1167 he went with Stephen, Count de Perche, into
Sicily, and was appointed tutor to the young King
William II., made keeper of his private seal, and
for two years conducted his education.<a name="FNanchor_335_335" id="FNanchor_335_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_335" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> Soon after
leaving Sicily, he was invited by Henry II. into
England,<a name="FNanchor_336_336" id="FNanchor_336_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_336" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> and made Archdeacon of Bath. It was
during the time he held that office that he wrote
most of these letters, from which we obtain a knowledge
of the above facts, and which he collected
together at the particular desire of King Henry;
who ever regarded him with the utmost kindness,
and bestowed upon him his lasting friendship. I
know not a more interesting or a more historically
valuable volume than these epistolary collections of
Archdeacon Peter. They seem to bring those old
times before us, to seat us by the fire-sides of our
Norman forefathers, and in a pleasant, quiet manner
enter into a gossip on the passing events of the
day; and being written by a student and an <i>amator
librorum</i>, they moreover unfold to us the state of
learning among the ecclesiastics at least of the
twelfth century; and if we were to take our worthy
archdeacon as a specimen, they possessed a far
better taste for these matters than we usually give
them credit for. Peter of Blois was no ordinary
man; a churchman, he was free from the prejudices
of churchmen&mdash;a visitant of courts and the associate<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224"></a>[<a href="./images/224.png">224</a>]</span>
of royalty, he was yet free from the sycophancy of
a courtier&mdash;and when he saw pride and ungodliness
in the church, or in high places, he feared not to
use his pen in stern reproof at these abominations.
It is both curious and extraordinary, when we bear
in mind the prejudices of the age, to find him
writing to a bishop upon the looseness of his
conduct, and reproving him for his inattention to
the affairs of his diocese, and upbraiding another
for displaying an unseemly fondness for hunting,<a name="FNanchor_337_337" id="FNanchor_337_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_337" class="fnanchor">[337]</a>
and other sports of the field; which he says is so
disreputable to one of his holy calling, and quotes
an instance of Pope Nicholas suspending and
excluding from the church Bishop Lanfred for a
similar offence; which he considers even more disgraceful
in Walter, Lord Bishop of Winchester, to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225"></a>[<a href="./images/225.png">225</a>]</span>
whom he is writing, on account of his advanced
age; he being at that time eighty years old. We
are constantly reminded in reading his letters that
we have those of an indefatigable student before
us; almost every page bears some allusion to his
books or to his studies, and prove how well and
deeply read he was in Latin literature; not merely
the theological writings of the church, but the
classics also. In one of his letters he speaks of his
own studies, and tells us that when he learnt the
art of versification and correct style, he did not
spend his time on legends and fables, but took his
models from Livy, Quintus Curtius, Trogus Pompeius,
Josephus, Tacitus, Suetonius, and other
classics; in the same letter he gives some directions
to the Archdeacon of Nantes, who had undertaken
the education of his nephews, as to the
manner of their study. He had received from the
archdeacon a flattering account of the progress
made by one of them named William, to which he
thus replies&mdash;"You speak," says he, "of William&mdash;his
great penetration and ingenious disposition,
who, without grammar or the authors of science,
which are both so desirable, has mastered the subtilties
of logic, so as to be esteemed a famous
logician, as I learn by your letter. But this is not
the foundation of a correct knowledge&mdash;these subtilties
which you so highly extol, are manifoldly
pernicious, as Seneca truly affirms,&mdash;<i>Odibilius nihil
est subtilitate ubi est sol&#339; subtilitas</i>. What indeed
is the use of these things in which you say he
spends his days&mdash;either at home, in the army, at
the bar, in the cloister, in the church, in the court,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226"></a>[<a href="./images/226.png">226</a>]</span>
or indeed in any position whatever, except, I suppose,
the schools?<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins> Seneca says, in writing to Lucalius,
"<i>Quid est, inquit acutius arista et in quo est
utiles!</i>"<a name="FNanchor_338_338" id="FNanchor_338_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_338" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> In many letters we find him quoting
the classics with the greatest ease, and the most
appropriate application to his subject; in one he
refers to Ovid, Persius, and Seneca,<a name="FNanchor_339_339" id="FNanchor_339_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_339" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> and in others,
when writing in a most interesting and amusing
manner of poetic fame and literary study, he
extracts from Terence, Ovid, Juvenal, Horace,
Plato, Cicero, Valerius Maximus, Seneca, etc.<a name="FNanchor_340_340" id="FNanchor_340_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_340" class="fnanchor">[340]</a>
In another, besides a constant use of Scripture,
which proves how deeply read too he was in Holy
Writ, he quotes with amazing prodigality from
Juvenal, Frontius, Vigetius, Dio, Virgil, Ovid,
Justin, Horace, and Plutarch.<a name="FNanchor_341_341" id="FNanchor_341_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_341" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> Indeed, Horace
was a great favorite with the archdeacon, who often
applied some of his finest sentences to illustrate his
familiar chat and epistolary disquisitions.<a name="FNanchor_342_342" id="FNanchor_342_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_342" class="fnanchor">[342]</a> It is
worth noticing that in one he quotes the Roman
history of Sallust, in six books, which is now lost,
save a few fragments; the passage relates to Pompey
the Great.<a name="FNanchor_343_343" id="FNanchor_343_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_343" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> We can scarcely refrain from a
smile at the eagerness of Archdeacon Peter in persuading
his friends to relinquish the too enticing
study of frivolous plays, which he says can be of no
service to the interest of the soul;<a name="FNanchor_344_344" id="FNanchor_344_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_344" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> and then, for<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227"></a>[<a href="./images/227.png">227</a>]</span>getting
this admonition, sending for tragedies and
comedies himself, that he might get them transcribed.<a name="FNanchor_345_345" id="FNanchor_345_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_345" class="fnanchor">[345]</a>
This puts one in mind of a certain
modern divine, whose conduct not agreeing with
his doctrine, told his hearers not to do as he did,
but as he told them. It appears also equally
ludicrous to find him upbraiding a monk, named
Peter of Blois, for studying the pagan authors: "the
foolish old fables of Hercules and Jove," their lies
and philosophy;<a name="FNanchor_346_346" id="FNanchor_346_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_346" class="fnanchor">[346]</a> when, as we have seen, he read
them so ravenously, and so greatly borrowed from
them himself. But then we must bear in mind that
the archdeacon had also well stored his mind with
Scripture, and certainly always deemed <i>that</i> the
first and most important of all his studies, which
was perhaps not the case with the monk to whom
he writes. In some of his letters we have pleasing
pictures of the old times presented to us, and it is
astonishing how homely and natural they read,
after the elapse of 700 years. In more than one
he launches out in strong invectives against the
lawyers, who in all ages seems to have borne the
indignation of mankind; Peter accuses them of
selling their knowledge for hire, to the direct perversion
of all justice; of favoring the rich and
oppressing the poor.<a name="FNanchor_347_347" id="FNanchor_347_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_347" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> He reproves Reginald,
Archdeacon of Salisbury, for occupying his time
with falconry, instead of attending to his clerical
duties; and in another, a most interesting letter, he
gives a description of King Henry II., whose
character he extols in panegyric terms, and proves
how much superior he was in learning to Wil<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228"></a>[<a href="./images/228.png">228</a>]</span>liam
II. of Sicily. He says that "Henry, as often
as he could breathe from his care and solicitudes,
he was occupied in secret reading; or at other
times joined by a body of clergy, would try to solve
some elaborate question <i>qu&aelig;stiones laborat evolvere</i>.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_348_348" id="FNanchor_348_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_348" class="fnanchor">[348]</a>
Frequently we find him writing about books,
begging transcripts, eagerly purchasing them;
and in one of his letters to Alexander, Abbot of
Jenniege, <i>Gemiticensem</i>, he writes, apologizing, and
begging his forgiveness for not having fulfilled his
promise in returning a book which he had borrowed
from his library, and begs that his friend will yet
allow him to retain it some days longer.<a name="FNanchor_349_349" id="FNanchor_349_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_349" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> The
last days of a scholar's life are not always remarkable,
and we know nothing of those of Archdeacon
Peter; for after the death of Henry II., his intellectual
worth found no royal mind to appreciate it.
The lion-hearted Richard thought more of the
battle axe and crusading than the encouragement
of literature or science; and Peter, like many other
students, grown old in their studies, was left in his
age to wander among his books, unmolested and
uncared for. With the friendship of a few clerical
associates, and the archdeaconry of London, which
by the bye was totally unproductive,<a name="FNanchor_350_350" id="FNanchor_350_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_350" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> he died, and
for many ages was forgotten. But a student's
worth can never perish; a time is certain to arrive
when his erudition will receive its due reward of
human praise. We now, after a slumber of many
hundred years, begin to appreciate his value, and
to entertain a hearty friendship and esteem for the

granted the monks of the monastery of St. Bertin, in the time of
Abbot Odlando, the privilege of hunting in his forests for the purpose
of procuring leather to bind their books. "Odlando Abbate hujus
loci abbas nonus, in omni bonitate suo pr&aelig;decessori Hardrado
co&aelig;qualis anno primo sui regiminis impetravit &agrave; rege Carolo privilegium
venandi in silvis nostris et aliis ubicumque constitutis, ad volumina

Aprilis, anno xxvi. regni nostri." Martene Thasaurus Nov. Anecdotorum
iii. 498. <i>Warton</i> mentions a similar instance of a grant to
the monks of St. Sithin, <i>Dissert.</i> ii. <i>prefixed to Hist. of Eng. Poetry</i>,
but he quotes it with some sad misrepresentations, and refers to
<i>Mabillon De re Diplomatica</i>, 611. Mr. Maitland, in his <i>Dark Ages</i>,
has shown the absurdity of Warton's inferences from the fact, and
proved that it was to the servants, or <i>eorum homines</i>, that Charlemagne
granted this uncanonical privilege, p. 216. But I find no such
restriction in the case I have quoted above. Probably, however, it
was thought needless to express what might be inferred, or to caution
against a practice so uncongenial with the christian duties of a
monk.</p></div>

<p><span class="smcap">n</span> the olden time the monks of Winchester<a name="FNanchor_351_351" id="FNanchor_351_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_351" class="fnanchor">[351]</a>
were renowned for their
calligraphic and pictorial art. The
choice book collectors of the day
sought anxiously for volumes produced
by these ingenious scribes,
and paid extravagant prices for
them. A superb specimen of their skill was
executed for Bishop Ethelwold; that enlightened
and benevolent prelate was a great patron of art<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230"></a>[<a href="./images/230.png">230</a>]</span>
and literature, and himself a grammaticus and poet
of no mean pretensions. He did more than any
other of his time to restore the architectural beauties
which were damaged or destroyed by the fire
and sword of the Danish invaders. His love of
these undertakings, his industry in carrying them
out, and the great talent he displayed in their
restoration, is truly wonderful to observe. He is
called by Wolstan, his biographer, "a great builder
of churches, and divers other works."<a name="FNanchor_352_352" id="FNanchor_352_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_352" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> He was
fond of learning, and very liberal in diffusing the
knowledge which he acquired; and used to instruct
the young by reading to them the Latin authors,
translated into the Saxon tongue. "He wrote a
Saxion version of the Rule of Saint Benedict, which
was so much admired, and so pleased King Edgar,
that he granted to him the manor of Sudborn,<a name="FNanchor_353_353" id="FNanchor_353_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_353" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> as
a token of his approbation."</p>

<p>Among a number of donations which he bequeathed
to this monastery, twenty volumes are
enumerated, embracing some writings of Bede and
Isidore.<a name="FNanchor_354_354" id="FNanchor_354_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_354" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> As a proof of his bibliomanical propensities,
I refer the reader to the celebrated Benedictional
of the Duke of Devonshire; that rich gem,
with its resplendent illuminations, place it beyond
the shadow of a doubt, and prove Ethelwold to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231"></a>[<a href="./images/231.png">231</a>]</span>
have been an <i>amator librorum</i> of consummate taste.
This fine specimen of Saxon ingenuity is the production
of a cloistered monk of Winchester, named
Godemann, who transcribed it at the bishop's
special desire, as we learn, from the following
lines:&mdash;</p></div>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"<i>Presentem Biblum iusset prescribere Presul.</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Wintoni&aelig; Dus que fecerat esse Patronum</i><br /></span>
<span class="i0"><i>Magnus &AElig;thelwoldus.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_355_355" id="FNanchor_355_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_355" class="fnanchor">[355]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Godemann, the scribe, entreats the prayers of
his readers, and wishes "all who gaze on this book
to ever pray that after the end of the flesh I may
inherit health in heaven: this is the fervent prayer
of the scribe, the humble Godemann." This
talented illuminator was chaplain to Ethelwold,
and afterwards abbot of Thorney.<a name="FNanchor_356_356" id="FNanchor_356_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_356" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> The choice
Benedictional in the public library of Rouen is also
ascribed to his elegant pen, and adds additional
lustre of his artistic fame.<a name="FNanchor_357_357" id="FNanchor_357_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_357" class="fnanchor">[357]</a></p>

<p>Most readers have heard of Walter, (who was
prior of St. Swithin in 1174,) giving twelve measures
of barley and a pall, on which was embroidered
in silver the history of St. Berinus converting a
Saxon king, for a fine copy of Bede's Homilies and
St. Austin's Psalter;<a name="FNanchor_358_358" id="FNanchor_358_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_358" class="fnanchor">[358]</a> and of Henry, a monk of the
Benedictine Abbey of Hyde, near there, who transcribed,
in the year 1178, Terence, Boethius, Seutonius
and Claudian; and richly illuminated and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232"></a>[<a href="./images/232.png">232</a>]</span>
bound them, which he exchanged with a neighboring
bibliophile for a life of St. Christopher,
St. Gregory's Pastoral Care, and four Missals.<a name="FNanchor_359_359" id="FNanchor_359_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_359" class="fnanchor">[359]</a>
Nicholas, Bishop of Winchester, left one hundred
marks and a Bible, with a fine gloss, in two large
volumes, to the convent of St. Swithin. John de
Pontissara, who succeeded that bishop in the year
1282, borrowed this valuable manuscript to benefit
and improve his biblical knowledge by a perusal of
its numerous notes. So great was their regard for
this precious gift, that the monks demanded a bond
for its return; a circumstance which has caused
some doubt as to the plenitude of the Holy Scriptures
in the English Church during that period; at
least among those who have only casually glanced
at the subject. I may as well notice that the
ancient Psalter in the Cottonian Library<a name="FNanchor_360_360" id="FNanchor_360_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_360" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> was
written about the year 1035, by the "most humble
brother and monk &AElig;lsinus," of Hyde Abbey. The
table prefixed to the volume records the deaths of
other eminent scribes and illuminators, whose
names are mingled with the great men of the
day;<a name="FNanchor_361_361" id="FNanchor_361_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_361" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> showing how esteemed they were, and how
honorable was their avocation. Thus under the
15th of May we find "<i>Obitus &AElig;therici m&ordm; picto</i>;"
and again, under the 5th of July, "<i>Obit Wulfrici
m&ordm; pictoris</i>." Many were the choice transcripts
made and adorned by the Winchester monks.</p>

<p>The monastery of Reading, in Berkshire, possessed
during the reign of Henry the Third a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233"></a>[<a href="./images/233.png">233</a>]</span>
choice library of a hundred and fifty volumes. It
is printed in the Supplement to the History of
Reading, from the original prefixed to the Woollascot
manuscripts. But it is copied very inaccurately,
and with many grievous omissions;
nevertheless it will suffice to enable us to gain a
knowledge of the class of books most admired by
the monks of Reading; and the Christian reader
will be glad to learn that the catalogue opens, as
usual, with the Holy Scriptures. Indeed no less
than four fine large and complete copies of the
Bible are enumerated. The first in two volumes;
the second in three volumes; the third in two, and
the fourth in the same number which was transcribed
by the <i>Cantor</i>, and kept in the cloisters for
the use of the monks. But in addition to these,
which are in themselves quite sufficient to exculpate
the monks from any charge of negligence of
Bible reading, we find a long list of separate portions
of the Old and New Testament; besides
many of the most important works of the Fathers,
and productions of medi&aelig;val learning, as the following
names will testify:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Ambrose.</li>
<li>Augustine.</li>
<li>Basil.</li>
<li>Bede.</li>
<li>Cassidorus.</li>
<li>Eusebius.</li>
<li>Gregory.</li>
<li>Hilarius.</li>
<li>Jerome.</li>
<li>Josephus.</li>
<li>Lombard.</li>
<li>Macrobius.</li>
<li>Origen.</li>
<li>Plato.</li>
<li>Prosper.</li>
<li>Rabanus Maurus.</li>
</ul>

<p>They possessed also the works of Geoffry of Monmouth;
the <i>Vita Karoli et Alexandri et gesta
Normannorum</i>; a "Ystoria Rading," and many
others equally interesting; and among the books
given by Radbert of Witchir, we find a Juvenal,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234"></a>[<a href="./images/234.png">234</a>]</span>
the Bucolics and Georgics of Virgil, and the "Ode
et Poetria et Sermone et Epistole Oratii.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: original reads .,'">"</ins> But
certainly the most striking characteristic is the fine
biblical collection contained in their library, which
is well worthy our attention, if not our admiration:
not but that we find them in other libraries much
less extensive. In those monasteries whose poverty
would not allow the purchase of books in any
quantity, and whose libraries could boast but of
some twenty or thirty volumes, it is scarcely to be
expected that they should be found rich in profane
literature; but it is deeply gratifying to find, as we
generally do, the Bible first on their little list;
conveying a proof by this prominence, in a quiet
but expressive way, how highly they esteemed that
holy volume, and how essential they deemed its
possession. Would that they had profited more
by its holy precepts!</p>

<p>We find an instance of this, and a proof of
their fondness for the Bible, in the catalogue of
the books in Depying Priory,<a name="FNanchor_362_362" id="FNanchor_362_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_362" class="fnanchor">[362]</a> in Lincolnshire;
which, containing a collection of twenty-three volumes,
enumerates a copy of the Bible first on the
humble list. The catalogue is as follows:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>These are the books in the library of the monks of Depying.<a name="FNanchor_363_363" id="FNanchor_363_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_363" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></li>

<li>The Bible.</li>
<li>The first part of the Morals of Pope St. Gregory.</li>
<li>The second part of the Morals by the same.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235"></a>[<a href="./images/235.png">235</a>]</span></li>

<p>There is not much in this scanty collection, the
loss of which we need lament; nor does it inspire
us with a very high notion of the learning of the
monks of Depying Priory. Yet how cheering it is
to find that the Bible was studied in this little cell;
and I trust the monk often drew from it many
words of comfort and consolation. Where is the
reader who will not regard these instances of Bible
reading with pleasure? Where is the Christian
who will not rejoice that the Gospel of Christ was
read and loved in the turbulent days of the Norman
monarchs? Where is the philosopher who will
affirm that we owe nothing to this silent but effectual
and fervent study? Where is he who will
maintain that the influence of the blessed and
abundant charity&mdash;the cheering promises, and the
sweet admonitions of love and mercy with which
the Gospels overflow&mdash;aided nothing in the progress<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236"></a>[<a href="./images/236.png">236</a>]</span>
of civilization? Where is the Bible student who
will believe that all this reading of the Scriptures
was unprofitable because, forsooth, a monk preached
and taught it to the multitude?</p>

<p>Let the historian open his volumes with a new
interest, and ponder over their pages with a fresh
spirit of inquiry; let him read of days of darkness
and barbarity; and as he peruses on, trace the
origin of the light whose brightness drove the darkness
and barbarity away. How much will he trace
to the Bible's influence; how often will he be compelled
to enter a convent wall to find in the gospel
student the one who shone as a redeeming light
in those old days of iniquity and sin; and will he
deny to the Christian priest his gratitude and love,
because he wore the cowl and mantle of a monk,
or because he loved to read of saints whose lives
were mingled with lying legends, or because he
chose a life which to us looks dreary, cold, and
heartless. Will he deny him a grateful recollection
when he reads of how much good he was permitted
to achieve in the Church of Christ; of how
many a doubting heart he reassured; of how many
a soul he fired with a true spark of Christian love;
when he reads of how the monk preached the faith
of Christ, and how often he led some wandering
pilgrim into the path of vital truth by the sweet
words of the dear religion which he taught; when
he reads that the hearts of many a Norman chief
was softened by the sweetness of the gospel's voice,
and his evil passions were lulled by the hymn of
praise which the monk devoutly sang to his Master
in heaven above. But speaking of the existence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237"></a>[<a href="./images/237.png">237</a>]</span>
the Bible among the monks puts me in mind of the
Abbey of Ramsey and its fine old library of books,
which was particularly rich in biblical treasures.
Even superior to Reading, as regards its biblical
collection, was the library of Ramsey. A portion
of an old catalogue of the library of this monastery
has been preserved, apparently transcribed about
the beginning of the fourteenth century, during the
warlike reign of Richard the Second. It is one of
the richest and most interesting relics of its kind
extant, at least of those to be found in our own
public libraries; and a perusal of it will not fail to
leave an impression on the mind that the monks
were far wealthier in their literary stores than we
previously imagined. Originally on two or three
skins, it is now torn into five separate pieces,<a name="FNanchor_364_364" id="FNanchor_364_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_364" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> and
in other respects much dilapidated. The writing
also in some parts is nearly obliterated, so as to
render the document scarcely readable. It is much
to be regretted that this interesting catalogue is
but a portion of the original; in its complete form
it would probably have described twice as many
volumes; but a fragment as it is, it nevertheless
contains the titles of more than <i>eleven hundred
books</i>, with the names of many of their donors
attached. A creditable and right worthy testimonial
this, of the learning and love of books prevalent
among the monks of Ramsey Monastery.
More than seven hundred of this goodly number<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238"></a>[<a href="./images/238.png">238</a>]</span>
were of a miscellaneous nature, and the rest were
principally books used in the performance of divine
service. Among these there were no less than
seventy Breviaries; thirty-two Grails; twenty-nine
Processionals; and one hundred Psalters! The
reader will regard most of these as superstitious
and useless; nor should I remark upon them did
they not show that books were not so scarce in
those times as we suppose; as this prodigality
satisfactorily proves, and moreover testifies to the
unceasing industry of the monkish scribes. We
who are used to the speed of the printing press and
its fertile abundance can form an opinion of the
labor necessary to transcribe this formidable array
of papistical literature. Four hundred volumes
transcribed with the plodding pen! each word collated
and each page diligently revised, lest a blunder
or a misspelt syllable should blemish those books so
deeply venerated. What long years of dry tedious
labor and monotonous industry was here!</p>

<p>But the other portion of the catalogue fully
compensates for this vast proportion of ecclesiastical
volumes. Besides several <i>Biblia optima in duobus
voluminibus</i>, or complete copies of the Bible, many
separate books of the inspired writers are noted
down; indeed the catalogue lays before us a superb
array of fine biblical treasures, rendered doubly
valuable by copious and useful glossaries; and embracing
many a rare Hebrew MS. Bible, <i>bibliotheca
hebraice</i>, and precious commentary. I count no
less than twenty volumes in this ancient language.
But we often find Hebrew manuscripts in the
monastic catalogues after the eleventh century.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239"></a>[<a href="./images/239.png">239</a>]</span>
The Jews, who came over in great numbers about
that time, were possessed of many valuable books,
and spread a knowledge of their language and
literature among the students of the monasteries.
And when the cruel persecution commenced against
them in the thirteenth century, they disposed of
their books, which were generally bought up by
the monks, who were ever hungry after such
acquisitions. Gregory, prior of Ramsey, collected
a great quantity of Hebrew MSS. in this way, and
highly esteemed the language, in which he became
deeply learned. At his death, in the year 1250, he
left them to the library of his monastery.<a name="FNanchor_365_365" id="FNanchor_365_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_365" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> Nor
was my lord prior a solitary instance; many others
of the same abbey, inspired by his example and
aided by his books, studied the Hebrew with equal
success. Brother Dodford, the Armarian, and
Holbeach, a monk, displayed their erudition in
writing a Hebrew lexicon.<a name="FNanchor_366_366" id="FNanchor_366_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_366" class="fnanchor">[366]</a></p>

<p>The library of Ramsey was also remarkably
rich in patristic lore. They gloried in the possession
of the works of Ambrose, Augustine, Anselm,
Basil, Boniface, Bernard, Gregory, and many
others equally voluminous. But it was not exclusively
to the study of such matters that these
monks applied their minds, they possessed a taste
for other branches of literature besides. They
read histories of the church, histories of England,
of Normandy, of the Jews; and histories of scholas<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240"></a>[<a href="./images/240.png">240</a>]</span>tic
philosophy, and many old chronicles which reposed
on their shelves. In science they appear to
have been equally studious, for the catalogue
enumerates works on medicine, natural history,
philosophy, mathematics, logic, dialects, arithmetic
and music! Who will say after this that the
monks were ignorant of the sciences and careless
of the arts? The classical student has perhaps ere
this condemned them for their want of taste, and
felt indignant at the absence of those authors of
antiquity whose names and works he venerates.
But the monks, far from neglecting those precious
volumes, were ever careful of their preservation;
they loved Virgil, Horace, and even Ovid, "heathen
dogs" as they were, and enjoyed a keen relish for
their beauties. I find in this catalogue the following
choice names of antiquity occur repeatedly:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>Aristotle.</li>
<li>Arian.</li>
<li>Boethius.</li>
<li>Claudius.</li>
<li>Dionysius.</li>
<li>Donatus.</li>
<li>Horace.</li>
<li>Josephus.</li>
<li>Justin.</li>
<li>Lucan.</li>
<li>Martial.</li>
<li>Macrobius.</li>
<li>Orosius.</li>
<li>Ovid.</li>
<li>Plato.</li>
<li>Priscian.</li>
<li>Prudentius.</li>
<li>Seneca.</li>
<li>Sallust.</li>
<li>Solinus.</li>
<li>Terence.</li>
<li>Virgil.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here were rich mines of ancient eloquence, and
fragrant flowers of poesy to enliven and perfume
the dull cloister studies of the monks. It is not
every library or reading society even of our own
time that possess so many gems of old. But other
treasures might yet be named which still further<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241"></a>[<a href="./images/241.png">241</a>]</span>
testify to the varied tastes and literary pursuits of
these monastic bibliophiles; but I shall content
myself with naming Peter of Blois, the Sentences
of Peter Lombard, of which they had several
copies, some enriched with choice commentaries
and notes, the works of Thomas Aquinas and
others of his class, a "Liber Ricardi," Dictionaries,
Grammars, and the writings of "Majestri Robi
Grostete," the celebrated Bishop of Lincoln, renowned
as a great <i>amator librorum</i> and collector
of Grecian literature. I might easily swell this
notice out to a considerable extent by enumerating
many other book treasures in this curious collection:
but enough has been said to enable the
reader to judge of the sort of literature the monks
of Ramsey collected and the books they read; and
if he should feel inclined to pursue the inquiry
further, I must refer him to the original manuscript,
promising him much gratification for his
trouble.<a name="FNanchor_367_367" id="FNanchor_367_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_367" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> It only remains for me to say that the
Vandalism of the Reformation swept all traces of
this fine library away, save the broken, tattered
catalogue we have just examined. But this is more
than has been spared from some. The abbey of
St. Edmunds Bury<a name="FNanchor_368_368" id="FNanchor_368_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_368" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> at one time must have enjoyed
a copious library, but we have no catalogue that I
am aware of to tell of its nature, not even a passing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242"></a>[<a href="./images/242.png">242</a>]</span>
notice of its well-stored shelves, except a few lines
in which Leland mentions some of the old manuscripts
he found therein.<a name="FNanchor_369_369" id="FNanchor_369_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_369" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> But a catalogue of their
library in the flourishing days of their monastery
would have disclosed, I imagine, many curious
works, and probably some singular writings on the
"<i>crafft off medycyne</i>," which Abbot Baldwin,
"<i>phesean</i>" to Edward the Confessor,<a name="FNanchor_370_370" id="FNanchor_370_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_370" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> had given
the monks, and of whom Lydgate thus speaks&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>We may equally deplore the loss of the catalogue
of the monastery of Ely, which, during the
middle ages, we have every reason to suppose possessed
a library of much value and extent. This
old monastery can trace its foundation back to a
remote period, and claim as its foundress, Etheldred&aelig;,<a name="FNanchor_372_372" id="FNanchor_372_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_372" class="fnanchor">[372]</a>
the daughter of Anna, King of the East
Angles, she was the wife of King Ecgfrid,<a name="FNanchor_373_373" id="FNanchor_373_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_373" class="fnanchor">[373]</a> with
whom she lived for twelve long years, though
during that time she preserved the glory of perfect
virginity, much to the annoyance of her royal<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243"></a>[<a href="./images/243.png">243</a>]</span>
spouse, who offered money and lands to induce
that illustrious virgin to waver in her resolution,
but without success. Her inflexible determination
at length induced her husband to grant her oft-repeated
prayer; and in the year 673 she retired
into the seclusion of monastic life,<a name="FNanchor_374_374" id="FNanchor_374_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_374" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> and building
the monastery of Ely, devoted her days to the
praise and glory of her heavenly King. Her pure
and pious life caused others speedily to follow her
example, and she soon became the virgin-mother of
a numerous progeny dedicated to God. A series
of astounding miracles attended her monastic life;
and sixteen years after her death, when her sister,
the succeeding abbess, opened her wooden coffin
to transfer her body to a more costly one of marble,
that "holy virgin and spouse of Christ" was found
entirely free from corruption or decay.<a name="FNanchor_375_375" id="FNanchor_375_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_375" class="fnanchor">[375]</a></p>

<p>A nunnery, glorying in so pure a foundress,
grew and flourished, and for "two hundred years
existed in the full observance of monastic discipline;"
but on the coming of the Danes in the year
870, those sad destroyers of religious establishments<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244"></a>[<a href="./images/244.png">244</a>]</span>
laid it in a heap of ruins, in which desolate condition
it remained till it attracted the attention of the
celebrated Ethelwold, who under the patronage of
King Edgar restored it; and endowing it with considerable
privileges appointed Brithnoth, Prior of
Winchester, its first abbot.<a name="FNanchor_376_376" id="FNanchor_376_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_376" class="fnanchor">[376]</a></p>

<p>Many years after, when Leoffin was abbot there,
and Canute was king, that monarch honored the
monastery of Ely with his presence on several
occasions. Monkish traditions say, that on one of
these visits as the king approached, he heard the
pious inmates of the monastery chanting their hymn
of praise; and so melodious were the voices of the
devotees, that his royal heart was touched, and he
poured forth his feelings in a Saxon ballad, commencing
thus:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Merry sang the monks of Ely,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">When Canute the king was sailing by;<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">Row ye knights near the land,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And let us hear these monks song."<a name="FNanchor_377_377" id="FNanchor_377_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_377" class="fnanchor">[377]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It reads smoother in Strutt's version; he renders it</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Cheerful sang the monk of Ely,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">When Canute the king was passing by;<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">Row to the shore knights, said the king,<br /></span>
<span class="ihalf">And let us hear these churchmen sing."<a name="FNanchor_378_378" id="FNanchor_378_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_378" class="fnanchor">[378]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>In addition to the title of a poet, Canute has
also received the appellation of a bibliomaniac.
Dibdin, in his bibliomania, mentions in a cursory
manner a few monkish book collectors, and intro<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245"></a>[<a href="./images/245.png">245</a>]</span>duces
Canute among them.<a name="FNanchor_379_379" id="FNanchor_379_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_379" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> The illuminated manuscript
of the four Gospels in the Danish tongue,
now in the British Museum, he writes, "and once
that monarch's own book leaves not the shadow
of a doubt of his bibliomanical character!" I cannot
however allow him that title upon such equivocal
grounds; for upon examination, the MS. turns out
to be in the Theotisc dialect, possessing no illuminations
of its own, and never perhaps once in
the hands of the royal poet.<a name="FNanchor_380_380" id="FNanchor_380_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_380" class="fnanchor">[380]</a></p>

<p>From the account books of Ely church we may
infer that the monks there enjoyed a tolerable
library; for we find frequent entries of money
having been expended for books and materials connected
with the library; thus in the year 1300 we
find that they bought at one time five dozen parchment,
four pounds of ink, eight calf and four
sheep-skins for binding books; and afterwards
there is another entry of five dozen vellum and six
pair of book clasps, a book of decretals for the
library, 3s., a Speculum Gregor, 2s., and "<i>Pro
tabula Paschalis fac denova et illuminand</i>," 4s.<a name="FNanchor_381_381" id="FNanchor_381_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_381" class="fnanchor">[381]</a>
They frequently perhaps sent one of the monks to
distants parts to purchase or borrow books for
their library; a curious instance of this occurs
under the year 1329, when they paid "the pre<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246"></a>[<a href="./images/246.png">246</a>]</span>centor
for going to Balsham to enquire for books,
6s. 7d." The bookbinder two weeks' wages, 4s.;
twelve iron chains to fasten books, 4s.; five dozen
vellum, 25s. 8d. In the year 1396, they paid their
librarian 53s. 4d., and a tunic for his services during
one year.<a name="FNanchor_382_382" id="FNanchor_382_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_382" class="fnanchor">[382]</a></p>

<p>Nigel, Bishop of Ely, by endowing the Scriptorium,
enabled the monks to produce some excellent
transcripts; they added several books of Cassiodorus,
Bede, Aldelem, Radbert, Andres, etc., to
the library;<a name="FNanchor_383_383" id="FNanchor_383_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_383" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> and they possessed at one time no
less than thirteen fine copies of the Gospels, which
were beautifully bound in gold and silver.<a name="FNanchor_384_384" id="FNanchor_384_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_384" class="fnanchor">[384]</a></p>

<p><span class="smcap">he</span> efficacy of "Good Works" was
a principle ever inculcated by the
monks of old. It is sad to reflect,
that vile deeds and black intentions
were too readily forgiven
and absolved by the Church on
the performance of some <i>good
deed</i>; or that the monks should dare to shelter or
to gloss over those sins which their priestly duty
bound them to condemn, because forsooth some
wealthy baron could spare a portion of his broad
lands or coffered gold to extenuate them. But
this forms one of the dark stains of the monastic
system; and the monks, I am sorry to say, were
more readily inclined to overlook the blemish, be<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248"></a>[<a href="./images/248.png">248</a>]</span>cause
it proved so profitable to their order. And
thus it was, that the proud and noble monastery of
St. Alban's was endowed by a murderer's hand, and
built to allay the fierce tortures of an assassin's
conscience. Ethelbert, king of the East Angles,
fell by the regal hand of Offa, king of Mercia;
and from the era of that black and guilty deed
many a fine monastery dates its origin and owes
its birth.</p>

<p>St. Alban's was founded, as its name implies, in
honor of the English protomartyr, whose bones
were said to have been discovered on that interesting
site, and afterwards preserved with veneration
in the abbey. In the ancient times, the building
appears to have covered a considerable space, and
to have been of great magnitude and power; for
ruins of its former structure mark how far and wide
the foundation spreads.</p></div>

<p>"The glorious king Offa," as the monks in their
adulation style him, richly endowed the monastery
on its completion, as we learn from the old chronicles
of the abbey; and a succession of potent
sovereigns are emblazoned on the glittering parchment,
whose liberalty augmented or confirmed
these privileges.<a name="FNanchor_385_385" id="FNanchor_385_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_385" class="fnanchor">[385]</a></p>

<p>Willigod, the first abbot, greatly enriched the
monastery, and bestowed especial care upon the
relics of St. Alban. It is curious to mark how
many perils those shrivelled bones escaped, and
with what anxious care the monks preserved them.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249"></a>[<a href="./images/249.png">249</a>]</span>
In the year 930, during the time of Abbot Eadfrid,
the Danes attacked the abbey, and after many
destroying acts broke open the repository, and
carried away some of the bones of St. Alban into
their own country.<a name="FNanchor_386_386" id="FNanchor_386_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_386" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> The monks took greater care
than ever of the remaining relics; and their anxiety
for their safety, and the veneration with which they
regarded them, is curiously illustrated by an anecdote
of Abbot Leofric, elected in the year 1006.
His abbacy was, therefore, held in troubled times;
and in the midst of fresh invasions and Danish
cruelties. Fearing lest they should a second time
reach the abbey, he determined to protect by
stratagem what he could not effect by force. After
hiding the genuine bones of St. Alban in a place
quite secure from discovery, he sent an open message
to the Abbot of Ely, entreating permission to
deposit the holy relics in his keeping; and offering,
as a plausible reason, that the monastery of Ely,
being surrounded by marshy and impenetrable
bogs, was secure from the approaches of the barbarians.
He accompanied this message with some
false relics&mdash;the remains of an old monk belonging
to the abbey enclosed in a coffin&mdash;and sent with
them a worn antiquated looking mantle, pretending
that it formerly belonged to Amphibalus, the master
of St. Alban.<a name="FNanchor_387_387" id="FNanchor_387_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_387" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> The monks of Ely joyfully received
these precious bones, and displayed perhaps too
much eagerness in doing so. Certain it is, that
when the danger was past and the quietude of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250"></a>[<a href="./images/250.png">250</a>]</span>
country was restored, Leofric, on applying for the
restitution of these "holy relics," found some difficulty
in obtaining them; for the Abbot of Ely
attempted by equivocation and duplicity to retain
them. After several ineffectual applications, Leofric
was compelled, for the honor of his monastery,
to declare the "pious fraud" he had practised;
which he proved by the testimony of several monks
of his fraternity, who were witnesses of the transaction.
It is said, that Edward the Confessor was
highly incensed at the conduct of the Abbot of
Ely.</p>

<p>I have stated elsewhere, that the learned and
pious &AElig;lfric gave the monastery many choice
volumes. His successor, Ealdred, abbot, about the
year 955, was quite an antiquary in his way; and no
spot in England afforded so many opportunities to
gratify his taste as the site of the ancient city of
Verulam. He commenced an extensive search
among the ruins, and rescued from the earth a vast
quantity of interesting and valuable remains. He
stowed all the stone-work and other materials
which were serviceable in building away, intending
to erect a new edifice for the monks: but death
prevented the consummation of these designs.
Eadmer, his successor, a man of great piety and
learning, followed up the pursuit, and made some
important accessions to these stores. He found
also a great number of gold and silver ornaments,
specimens of ancient art, some of them of a most
costly nature, but being idols or figures connected
with heathen mythology, he cared not to preserve
them. Matthew Paris is prolix in his account of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251"></a>[<a href="./images/251.png">251</a>]</span>
the operations and discoveries of this abbot; and
one portion of it is so interesting, and seems so
connected with our subject, that I cannot refrain
from giving it to the reader. "The abbot," he
writes, "whilst digging out the walls and searching
for the ruins which were buried in the earth in the
midst of the ancient city, discovered many vestiges
of the foundation of a great palace. In a recess in
one of the walls he found the remains of a library,
consisting of a number of books and rolls; and
among them a volume in an unknown tongue, and
which, although very ancient, had especially escaped
destruction. This nobody in the monastery could
read, nor could they at that time find any one who
understood the writing or the idiom; it was exceedingly
ancient, and the letters evidently were
most beautifully formed; the inscriptions or titles
were written in gold, and encircled with ornaments;
bound in oak with silken bands, which still
retained their strength and beauty; so perfectly
was the volume preserved. But they could not
conceive what the book was about; at last, after
much search and diligent inquiry, they found a very
feeble and aged priest, named Unwon, who was
very learned in writings <i>literis bene eruditum</i>, and
imbued with the knowledge of divers languages.
He knew directly what the volume was about, and
clearly and fluently read the contents; he also explained
the other <i>Codices</i> found in the same library
<i>in eodem Almariolo</i> of the palace with the greatest
ease, and showed them to be written in the characters
formerly in use among the inhabitants of Verulam,
and in the language of the ancient Britons.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252"></a>[<a href="./images/252.png">252</a>]</span>
Some, however, were in Latin; but the book before-mentioned
was found to be the history of Saint
Alban, the English proto-martyr, according to that
mentioned by Bede, as having been daily used in
the church. Among the other books were discovered
many contrivances for the invocation and
idolatrous rites of the people of Verulam, in which
it was evident that Ph&#339;bus the god Sol was especially
invoked and worshipped; and after him
Mercury, called in English Woden, who was the
god of the merchants. The books which contained
these diabolical inventions they cast away and
burnt; but that precious treasure, the history of
Saint Alban, they preserved, and the priest before-mentioned
was appointed to translate the ancient
English or British into the vulgar tongue.<a name="FNanchor_388_388" id="FNanchor_388_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_388" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> By
the prudence of the Abbot Eadmer, the brothers
of the convent made a faithful copy, and diligently
explained it in their public teaching; they also
translated it into Latin, in which it is now known
and read; the historian adds that the ancient and
original copy, which was so curiously written, instantaneously
crumbled into dust and was destroyed
for ever.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_389_389" id="FNanchor_389_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_389" class="fnanchor">[389]</a></p>

<p>Although the attention of the Saxon abbots
was especially directed to literary matters, and to
the affairs connected with the making of books, we
find no definite mention of a Scriptorium, or of
manuscripts having been transcribed as a regular
and systematic duty, till after the Norman con<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253"></a>[<a href="./images/253.png">253</a>]</span>quest.
That event happened during the abbacy of
Frederic, and was one which greatly influenced
the learning of the monks. Indeed, I regard the
Norman conquest as a most propitious event for
English literature, and one which wrought a vast
change in the aspect of monastic learning; the
student of those times cannot fail to perceive the
revolution which then took place in the cloisters;
visibly accomplished by the installation of Norman
bishops and the importation of Norman monks,
who in the well regulated monasteries of France and
Normandy had been initiated into a more general
course of study, and brought up in a better system
of mental training than was known here at that
time.</p>

<p>But poor Frederic, a conscientious and worthy
monk, suffered severely by that event, and was
ultimately obliged to seek refuge in the monastery
of Ely to evade the displeasure of the new sovereign;
but his earthly course was well nigh run,
for three days after, death released him from his
worldly troubles, and deprived the conqueror of a
victim. Paul, the first of the Norman abbots, was
appointed by the king in the year 1077. He was
zealous and industrious in the interest of the abbey,
and obtained the restitution of many lands and
possessions of which it had been deprived; he
rebuilt the old and almost ruined church, and employed
for that purpose many of the materials
which his predecessors had collected from the ruins
of Verulam; and even now, I believe, some remnants
of these Roman tiles, etc., may be discerned.
He moreover obtained many important grants and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254"></a>[<a href="./images/254.png">254</a>]</span>
valuable donations; among others a layman named
Robert, one of the Norman leaders, gave him two
parts of the tythes of his domain at Hatfield,
which he had received from the king at the distribution.</p>

<p>"This he assigned," says Matthew Paris, "to
the disposal of Abbot Paul, who was a lover of the
Scriptures, for the transcription of the necessary
volumes for the monastery. He himself indeed
was a learned soldier, and a diligent hearer and
lover of Scripture; to this he also added the tythes
of Redburn, appointing certain provisions to be
given to the scribes; this he did out of "charity to
the brothers that they may not thereby suffer, and
that no impediment might be offered to the writers.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins>
The abbot thereupon sought and obtained from
afar many renowned scribes, to write the necessary
books for the monastery. And in return for these
abundant favors, he presented, as a suitable gift to
the warlike Robert, for the chapel in his palace at
Hatfield, two pair of vestments, a silver cup, a
missal, and the other needful books (<i>missale cum
aliis libris necessariis</i>). Having thus presented to
him the first volumes produced by his liberality, he
proceeded to construct a scriptorium, which was
set apart (<i>pr&aelig;electos</i>) for the transcription of books;
Lanfranc supplied the copies. They thus procured
for the monastery twenty-eight notable volumes
(<i>volumina notabilia</i>), also eight psalters, a book of
collects, a book of epistles, a volume containing
the gospels for the year, two copies of the gospels
complete, bound in gold and silver, and ornamented
with gems; besides ordinals, constitutions, missals,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255"></a>[<a href="./images/255.png">255</a>]</span>
troapries, collects, and other books for the use of
the library.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_390_390" id="FNanchor_390_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_390" class="fnanchor">[390]</a></p>

<p>Thus blessed, we find the monks of St. Albans
for ages after constantly acquiring fresh treasures,
and multiplying their book stores by fruitful transcripts.
There is scarce an abbot, whose portrait
garnishes the fair manuscript before me, that is
not represented with some goodly tomes spread
around him, or who is not mentioned as a choice
"<i>amator librorum</i>," in these monkish pages. It is
a singular circumstance, when we consider how
bookless those ages are supposed to have been,
that the illuminated portraits of the monks are
most frequently depicted with some ponderous
volume before them, as if the idea of a monk and
the study of a book were quite inseparable. During
my search among the old manuscripts quoted in
this work, this fact has been so repeatedly forced
upon my attention that I am tempted to regard it
as an important hint, and one which speaks favorably
for the love of books and learning among the
cowled devotees of the monasteries.</p>

<p>Passing Richard de Albani, who gave them a
copy of the gospels, a missal written in letters of
gold, an other precious volumes whose titles are
unrecorded,<a name="FNanchor_391_391" id="FNanchor_391_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_391" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> we come to Geoffry, a native of
Gorham, who was elected abbot in the year 1119.
He had been invited over to England (before he
became a priest) by his predecessor, to superintend
the school of St. Albans; but he delayed the voyage<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256"></a>[<a href="./images/256.png">256</a>]</span>
so long, that on his arrival he found the appointment
already filled; on this he went to Dunstable,
where he read lectures, and obtained some pupils.
It was during his stay there that he wrote the piece
which has obtained for him so much reputation.
<i>Ubi quendam ludum de Sancta Katarin&aelig; quem
miracula vulgariter appellamus fecit</i>, says the Cotton
manuscripts, on the vellum page of which he
is portrayed in the act of writing it.<a name="FNanchor_392_392" id="FNanchor_392_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_392" class="fnanchor">[392]</a> Geoffry,
from this passage, is supposed to be the first author
of dramatic literature in England; although the
title seems somewhat equivocal, from the casual
manner in which his famous play of St. Catherine
is thus mentioned by Matthew Paris. Of its merits
we are still less able to form an opinion; for nothing
more than the name of that much talked of miracle
play has been preserved. We may conclude, however,
that it was performed with all the paraphernalia
of scenery and characteristic costume; for he
borrowed of the sacrist of St. Albans some copes
for this purpose. On the night following the
representation the house in which he resided was
burnt; and, says the historian, all his books, and
the copes he had borrowed were destroyed. Rendered
poor indeed by this calamity, and somewhat
reflecting upon himself for the event, he assumed
in sorrow and despair the religious habit, and
entered the monastery of St. Albans; where by
his deep study, his learning and his piety, he so
gained the hearts of his fraternity, that he ultimately
became their abbot. He is said to have been very
industrious in the transcription of books; and he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257"></a>[<a href="./images/257.png">257</a>]</span>
"made a missal bound in gold, <i>auro ridimitum</i>,
and another in two volumes; both incomparably
illuminated in gold, and written in a clear and
legible hand; also a precious Psalter similarly
illuminated; a book containing the Benedictions
and the Sacraments; a book of Exorcisms, and a
Collectaria."<a name="FNanchor_393_393" id="FNanchor_393_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_393" class="fnanchor">[393]</a></p>

<p>Geoffry was succeeded by Ralph de <ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'Gebium'">Gobium</ins> in
the year 1143: he was a monk remarkable for his
learning and his bibliomanical pursuits. He formerly
remained some time in the services of
Alexander, bishop of Lincoln, and gained the
esteem of that prelate. His book-loving passion
arose from hearing one "Master Wodon, of Italy,
expound the doctrines of the Holy Scriptures."
He from that time became a most enthusiastic
<i>amator librorum</i>; and collected, with great diligence,
an abundant multitude of books.<a name="FNanchor_394_394" id="FNanchor_394_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_394" class="fnanchor">[394]</a></p>

<p>The matters in which he was concerned, his
donations to the monastery, and the anecdotes of
his life, are all unconnected with my subject; so that
I am obliged to pass from this interesting monk,
an undoubted bibliophile, from sheer want of information.
I cannot but regret that the historian
does not inform us more fully of his book collecting
pursuits; but he is especially barren on
that subject, although he highly esteems him for
prosecuting that pleasing avocation. He died in
the year 1151, in the fourteenth of King Stephen,
and was followed by Robert de Gorham, who is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258"></a>[<a href="./images/258.png">258</a>]</span>
also commemorated as a bibliophile in the pages
of the Cotton manuscripts; and to judge from his
portrait, and the intensity with which he pores over
his volume, he was a hard and devoted student.
He ordered the scribes to make a great many
books; indeed, adds Paris the historian, who was
himself somewhat of an <i>amator librorum</i>, "more
by far than can be mentioned."<a name="FNanchor_395_395" id="FNanchor_395_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_395" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> From another
source we learn that these books were most sumptuously
bound.<a name="FNanchor_396_396" id="FNanchor_396_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_396" class="fnanchor">[396]</a></p>

<p>During the days of this learned abbot a devout
and humble clerk asked admission at the abbey
gate. Aspiring to a holy life, he ardently hoped,
by thus spending his days in monastic seclusion, to
render his heart more acceptable to God. Hearing
his prayer, the monks conducted him into the
presence of my Lord Abbot, who received him
with compassionate tenderness, and kindly questioned
him as to his qualifications for the duties
and sacred responsibilities of the monkish priesthood;
for even in those dark ages they looked a
little into the learning of the applicant before he
was admitted into their fraternity. But alas! the
poor clerk was found wofully deficient in this respect,
and was incapable of replying to the questions
of my Lord Abbot, who thereupon gently answered,
"My son, tarry awhile, and still exercise thyself in
study, and so become more perfect for the holy
office."</p>

<p>Abashed and disappointed, he retired with a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259"></a>[<a href="./images/259.png">259</a>]</span>
kindling blush of shame; and deeming this temporary
repulse a positive refusal he left his fatherland,
and started on a pilgrimage to France.<a name="FNanchor_397_397" id="FNanchor_397_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_397" class="fnanchor">[397]</a>
And who was this poor, humble, unlettered clerk?
Who this simple layman, whose ignorance rendered
him an unfit <i>socius</i> for the plodding monks of old
St. Albans Abbey? No less than the English
born Nicholas Brekespere, afterwards his Holiness
Adrian IV., Pope of Rome, Vicar-apostolic and
successor of St. Peter!</p>

<p>Yes; still bearing in mind the kind yet keen
reproof of the English abbot, on his arrival in a
foreign land he studied with all the depth and
intensity of despair, and soon surpassed his companions
in the pursuit of knowledge; and became
so renowned for learning, and for his prudence,
that he was made Canon of St. Rufus. His sagacity,
moreover, caused him to be chosen, on three separate
occasions, to undertake some important embassies
to the apostolic see; and at length he was
elected a cardinal. So step by step he finally became
elevated to the high dignity of the popedom.
The first and last of England's sons who held the
keys of Peter.</p>

<p>These shadows of the past&mdash;these shreds of a
forgotten age&mdash;these echoes of five hundred years,
are full of interest and instruction. For where
shall we find a finer example&mdash;a more cheering
instance of what perseverance will accomplish&mdash;or
a more satisfactory result of the pursuit of knowledge
under difficulties? Not only may these
curious facts cheer the dull student now, and inspire<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260"></a>[<a href="./images/260.png">260</a>]</span>
him with that energy so essential to success, but
these whisperings of old may serve as lessons for
ages yet to come. For if <i>we</i> look back upon those
dark days with such feelings of superiority, may
not the wiser generations of the future regard <i>us</i>
with a still more contemptuous, yet curious eye?
And when they look back at our Franklins, and
our Johnsons, in astonishment at such fine instances
of what perseverance could do, and what
energy and plodding industry could accomplish,
even when surrounded with the difficulties of <i>our</i>
ignorance; how much more will they praise this
bright example, in the dark background of the
historical tableaux, who, without even our means of
obtaining knowledge&mdash;our libraries or our talent&mdash;rose
by patient, hard and devoted study, from
Brekespere the humble clerk&mdash;the rejected of St.
Albans&mdash;to the proud title of Vicar-apostolic of
Christ and Pope of Rome!</p>

<p>Simon, an Englishman, a clerk and a "man of
letters and good morals," was elected abbot in the
year 1167. All my authorities concur in bestowing
upon him the honor and praise appertaining to a
bibliomaniac. He was, says one, an especial lover
of books, <i>librorum amator speciales</i>: and another
in panegyric terms still further dubs him an <i>amator
scripturarum</i>. All this he proved, and well earned
the distinction, by the great encouragement he gave
to the collecting and transcribing of books. The
monkish pens he found moving too slow, and yielding
less fruit than formerly. He soon, however, set
them hard at work again; and to facilitate their
labors, he added materially to the comforts of the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261"></a>[<a href="./images/261.png">261</a>]</span>
Scriptorium by repairing and enlarging it; "and
always," says the monk from whom I learn this,
"kept two or three most choice scribes in the
Camera (Scriptorium,) who sustained its reputation,
and from whence an abundant supply of the most
excellent books were continually produced.<a name="FNanchor_398_398" id="FNanchor_398_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_398" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> He
framed some efficient laws for its management, and
ordered that, in subsequent times, every abbot
should keep and support one able scribe at least.
Among the 'many choice books and authentic
volumes,' <i>volumina authentica</i>, which he by this
care and industry added to the abbey library, was
included a splendid copy of the Old and New
Testament, transcribed with great accuracy and
beautifully written&mdash;indeed, says the manuscript
history of that monastery, so noble a copy was
nowhere else to be seen.<a name="FNanchor_399_399" id="FNanchor_399_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_399" class="fnanchor">[399]</a> But besides this, Abbot
Simon gave them all those precious books which
he had been for a 'long time' collecting himself at
great cost and patient labor, and having bound
them in a sumptuous and marvellous manner,<a name="FNanchor_400_400" id="FNanchor_400_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_400" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> he
made a library for their reception near the tomb of
Roger the Hermit.<a name="FNanchor_401_401" id="FNanchor_401_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_401" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> He also bestowed many rich
ornaments and much costly plate on the monastery;
and by a long catalogue of good deeds, too
ample to be inserted here, he gained the affections
and gratitude of his fraternity, who loudly praised
his virtues and lamented his loss when they laid
him in his costly tomb. There is a curious illumination
of this monkish bibliophile in the Cotton
manuscript. He is represented deeply engaged<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262"></a>[<a href="./images/262.png">262</a>]</span>
with his studies amidst a number of massy volumes,
and a huge trunk is there before him crammed with
rough old fashioned large clasped tomes, quite enticing
to look upon."<a name="FNanchor_402_402" id="FNanchor_402_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_402" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p>After Simon came Garinus, who was soon succeeded
by one John. Our attention is arrested by
the learned renown of this abbot, who had studied
in his youth at Paris, and obtained the unanimous
praise of his masters for his assiduous attention
and studious industry. He returned with these
high honors, and was esteemed in grammar a
Priscian, in poetry an Ovid, and in physic equal to
Galen.<a name="FNanchor_403_403" id="FNanchor_403_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_403" class="fnanchor">[403]</a> With such literary qualifications, it was
to be expected the Scriptorium would flourish under
his government, and the library increase under his
fostering care. Our expectations are not disappointed;
for many valuable additions were made
during his abbacy, and the monks over whom he
presided gave many manifestations of refinement
and artistic talent, which incline us to regard the
ingenuity of the cloisters in a more favorable light.
Raymond, his prior, was a great help in all these
undertakings. His industry seems to have been
unceasing in beautifying the church, and looking
after the transcription of books. With the assistance
of Roger de Parco, the cellarer, he made a
large table very handsome, and partly fabricated
of metal. He wrote two copies of the Gospels,
and bound them in silver and gold adorned with<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263"></a>[<a href="./images/263.png">263</a>]</span>
various figures. Brother Walter of Colchester,
with Randulph, Gubium and others, produced some
very handsome paintings comprising the evangelists
and many holy saints, and hung them up in the
church. "As we have before mentioned, by the
care and industry of the lord Raymond, many noble
and useful books were transcribed and given to
the monastery. The most remarkable of these was
a Historia Scholastica, with allegorics, a most
elegant book&mdash;<i>liber elegantissimus</i> exclaims my
monkish authority.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_404_404" id="FNanchor_404_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_404" class="fnanchor">[404]</a> This leads me to say something
more of my lord prior, for the troubles which
the conscientious conduct of old Raymond brought
upon himself&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Implores the passing tribute of a sigh."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Be it known then that William de Trompington
succeeded to the abbacy on the death of John; but
he was a very different man, without much esteem
for learning; and thinking I am afraid far more of
the world and heaven or the <i>Domus Dei</i>. Alas!
memoirs of bad monks and worldly abbots are
sometimes found blotting the holy pages of the
monkish annals. <i>Domus Dei est porta c&#339;li</i>, said
the monks; and when they closed the convent
gates they did not look back on the world again,
but entered on that dull and gloomy path with a
full conviction that they were leaving all and following
Christ, and so acting in accordance with his
admonitions; but those who sought the convent to
forget in its solitude their worldly cares and worldly
disappointments, too often found how futile and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264"></a>[<a href="./images/264.png">264</a>]</span>
how ineffectual was that dismal life to eradicate the
grief of an overburdened heart, or to subdue the
violence of misguided temper. The austerity of
the monastic rules might tend to conquer passion
or moderate despair, but there was little within
those walls to drive painful recollections of the outward
world away; for at every interval between
their holy meditations and their monkish duties,
images of the earth would crowd back upon their
minds, and wring from their ascetic hearts tributes
of anguish and despair; and so we find the writings
and letters of the old monks full of vain regrets
and misanthropic thoughts, but sometimes overflowing
with the most touching pathos of human
misery. Yet the monk knew full well what his
duty was, and knew how sinful it was to repine or
rebel against the will of God. If he vowed obedience
to his abbot, he did not forget that obedience
was doubly due to Him; and strove with all the
strength that weak humanity could muster, to forget
the darkness of the past by looking forward with a
pious hope and a lively faith to the brightness and
glory of the future. By constant prayer the monk
thought more of his God, and gained help to
strengthen the faith within him; and by assiduous
and devoted study he disciplined his heart of flesh&mdash;tore
from it what lingering affection for the world
remained, and deserting all love of earth and all
love of kin, purged and purified it for his holy
calling, and closed its portals to render it inaccessible
to all sympathy of blood. If a thought of
those shut out from him by the monastic walls stole
across his soul and mingled with his prayer, he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265"></a>[<a href="./images/265.png">265</a>]</span>
started and trembled as if he had offered up an
unholy desire in the supplication. To him it was
a proof that his nature was not yet subdued; and a
day of study and meditation, with a fast unbroken
till the rays of the morrow's sun cast their light
around his little cell, absolved the sin, and broke
the tie that bound him to the world without.</p>

<p>If this violence was experienced in subduing
the tenderest of human sympathy; how much more
severe was the conflict of dark passions only half
subdued, or malignant depravity only partially reformed.
These dark lines of human nature were
sometimes prominent, even when the monk was
clothed in sackcloth and ashes; and are markedly
visible in the life of William de Trompington. But
let not the reader think that he was appointed with
the hearty suffrages of the fraternity, he was elected
at the recommendation of the "king," a very significant
term in those days of despotic rule, at
which choice became a mere farce. "Out of the
fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh;" and the
monks soon began to perceive with regret and
trembling the worldly ways of the new abbot, which
he could not hide even under his abbatical robes.
In a place dedicated to holy deeds and heavenly
thoughts, worldly conduct or unbridled passion
strikes the mind as doubly criminal, and loads the
heart with dismay and suffering; at least so my
lord Prior regarded it, whose righteous indignation
could no longer endure these manifestations of a
worldly mind. So he gently remonstrated with his
superior, and hinted at the impropriety of such
conduct. This was received not in Christian fellow<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266"></a>[<a href="./images/266.png">266</a>]</span>ship,
but with haughty and passionate displeasure;
and from that day the fate of poor Raymond was
irrevocably sealed. The abbot thinking to suppress
the dissatisfaction which was now becoming general
and particularly inconvenient, sent him a long distance
off to the cell of Tynmouth in Northumberland,
where all were strangers to him. Nor could
the tears of the old man turn the heart of his cruel
lord, nor the rebellious murmurings of the brothers
avail. Thank God such cases are not very frequent;
and the reader of monkish annals will not
find many instances of such cold and unfeeling
cruelty to distress his studies or to arouse his
indignation. But obedience was a matter of course
in the monastery; it was one of the most imperative
duties of the monk, and if not cheerfully he was
compelled to manifest alacrity in fulfilling even the
most unpleasant mandate. But I would have forgiven
this transaction on the score of <i>expediency</i>
perhaps, had not the abbot heaped additional insults
and cruelties upon the aged offender; but his books
which he had transcribed with great diligence and
care, he forcibly deprived him of, <i>violenter spoliatum</i>,
and so robbed him, as his historian says, of
all those things which would have been a comfort
and solace to his old age.<a name="FNanchor_405_405" id="FNanchor_405_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_405" class="fnanchor">[405]</a></p>

<p>The books which the abbot thus became dishonestly
possessed of&mdash;for I cannot regard it in
any other light&mdash;we are told he gave to the library
of the monastery; and he also presented some
books to more than one neighboring church.<a name="FNanchor_406_406" id="FNanchor_406_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_406" class="fnanchor">[406]</a><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267"></a>[<a href="./images/267.png">267</a>]</span>
But he was not bookworm himself, and dwelt I
suspect with greater fondness over his wealthy rent
roll than on the pages of the fine volumes in the
monastic library. The monks, however, amidst all
these troubles retained their love of books; indeed
it was about this time that John de Basingstoke,
who had studied at Athens, brought a valuable
collection of Greek books into England, and greatly
aided in diffusing a knowledge of that language
into this country. He was deacon of Saint Albans,
and taught many of the monks Greek; Nicholas,
a chaplain there, became so proficient in it, that he
was capable of greatly assisting bishop Grostete in
translating his Testament of the twelve patriarchs
into Latin.<a name="FNanchor_407_407" id="FNanchor_407_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_407" class="fnanchor">[407]</a></p>

<p>Roger de Northone, the twenty-fourth abbot of
Saint Albans, gave "many valuable and choice
books to the monastery," and among them the
commentaries of Raymond, Godfrey, and Bernard,
and a book containing the works and discourses of
Seneca. His bibliomaniacal propensities, and his
industry in transcribing books, is indicated by an
illumination representing this worthy abbot deeply
engrossed with his ponderous volumes.<a name="FNanchor_408_408" id="FNanchor_408_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_408" class="fnanchor">[408]</a></p>

<p>I have elsewhere related an anecdote of Wallingford,
abbot of St. Albans, and the sale of books
effected between him and Richard de Bury. It
appears that rare and munificent collector gave
many and various noble books, <i>multos et varios
libros nobiles</i>, to the monastery of St. Albans whilst<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268"></a>[<a href="./images/268.png">268</a>]</span>
he was bishop of Durham.<a name="FNanchor_409_409" id="FNanchor_409_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_409" class="fnanchor">[409]</a> Michael de Wentmore
succeeded Wallingford, and proved a very
valuable benefactor to the monastery; and by wise
regulations and economy greatly increased the
comforts and good order of the abbey. He gave
many books, <i>plures libros</i>, to the library, besides
two excellent Bibles,<a name="FNanchor_410_410" id="FNanchor_410_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_410" class="fnanchor">[410]</a> one for the convent and one
for the abbot's study, and to be kept especially for
his private reading; an ordinal, very beautiful to
look upon, being sumptuously bound.<a name="FNanchor_411_411" id="FNanchor_411_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_411" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> Indeed, so
<i>multis voluminibus</i> did he bestow, that he expended
more than 100<i>l.</i> in this way, an immense sum in
those old days, when a halfpenny a day was deemed
fair wages for a scribe.<a name="FNanchor_412_412" id="FNanchor_412_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_412" class="fnanchor">[412]</a></p>

<p>Wentmore was succeeded by Thomas de la
Mare, a man of singular learning, and remarkable
as a patron of it in others; it was probably by his
direction that John of Tynmouth wrote his Sanctilogium
Britann&aelig;, for that work was dedicated to
him. A copy, presented by Thomas de la Mare to
the church of Redburn, is in the British Museum,
much injured by fire, but retaining at the end the
following lines:</p>

<div class="blockquot"><p>"Hunc librum dedet Dominus Thomas de la Mare, Albas
monasterii S. Albani Anglorum Proto martyris Deo et
Ecclesi&aelig; B. Amphibali de Redburn, ut fratris indem in

<p>But there are few who have obtained so much
reputation as John de Whethamstede, perhaps the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269"></a>[<a href="./images/269.png">269</a>]</span>
most learned abbot of this monastery. He was
formerly monk of the cell at Tynmouth, and afterwards
prior of Gloucester College at Oxford, from
whence he was appointed to the government of
St. Albans. Whethamstede was a passionate bibliomaniac,
and when surrounded with his books he
cared little, or perhaps from the absence of mind
so often engendered by the delights of study, he
too frequently forgot, the important affairs of his
monastery, and the responsible duties of an abbot;
but absorbed as he was with his studies, Whethamstede
was not a mere</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">..... "Bookful blockhead ignorantly read<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With loads of learned lumber in his head."<br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>It is true he was an inveterate reader, amorously
inclined towards vellum tomes and illuminated
parchments; but he did not covet them like
some collectors for the mere pride of possessing
them, but gloried in feasting on their intellectual
charms and delectable wisdom, and sought in their
attractive pages the means of becoming a better
Christian and a wiser man. But he was so excessively
fond of books, and became so deeply
engrossed with his book-collecting pursuits, that it
is said some of the monks showed a little dissatisfaction
at his consequent neglect of the affairs of
the monastery; but these are faults I cannot find
the heart to blame him for, but am inclined to consider
his conduct fully redeemed by the valuable
encouragement he gave to literature and learning.
Generous to a fault, abundant in good deeds and
costly expenditure, he became involved in pecuniary<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270"></a>[<a href="./images/270.png">270</a>]</span>
difficulties, and found that the splendor and wealth
which he had scattered so lavishly around his
monastery, and the treasures with which he had
adorned the library shelves, had not only drained
his ample coffers, but left a large balance unsatisfied.
Influenced by this circumstance, and the
murmurings of the monks, and perhaps too, hoping
to obtain more time for study and book-collecting,
he determined to resign his abbacy, and again
become a simple brother. The proceedings relative
to this affair are curiously related by a contemporary,
John of Amersham.<a name="FNanchor_414_414" id="FNanchor_414_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_414" class="fnanchor">[414]</a> In Whethamstede's
address to the monks on this occasion, he thus
explains his reasons for the step he was about to
take. After a touching address, wherein he intimates
his determination, he says,<a name="FNanchor_415_415" id="FNanchor_415_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_415" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> "Ye have
known moreover how, from the first day of my
appointment even until this day, assiduously and
continually without any intermission I have shown
singular solicitude in four things, to wit, in the
erection of conventual buildings, <i>in the writing of
books</i>, in the renewal of vestments, and in the
acquisition of property. And perhaps, by reason
of this solicitude of mine, ye conceive that I have
fallen into debt; yet that you may know, learn
and understand what is in this matter the certain
and plain truth, and when ye know it ye may report
it unto others, know ye for certain, yea, for most<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271"></a>[<a href="./images/271.png">271</a>]</span>
certain, that for all these things about which, and
in which I have expended money, I am not indebted
to any one living more than 10,000 marks; but that
I wish freely to acknowledge this debt, and so to
make satisfaction to every creditor, that no survivor
of any one in the world shall have to demand anything
from my successor."</p>

<p>The monks on hearing this declaration were
sorely affected, and used every persuasion to induce
my lord abbot to alter his determination, but without
success; so that they were compelled to seek
another in whom to confide the government of
their abbey. Their choice fell upon John Stokes,
who presided over them for many years; but at his
death the love and respect which the brothers
entertained for Whethamstede, was manifested
by unanimously electing him again, an honor which
he in return could not find the heart to decline.
But during all this time, and after his restoration,
he was constantly attending to the acquisition of
books, and numerous were the transcripts made
under his direction by the scribes and enriched by
his munificence, for some of the most costly copies
produced in that century were the fruits of their
labor; during his time there were more volumes
transcribed than in that of any other abbot since
the foundation of the abbey, says the manuscript
from whence I am gleaning these details, and adds
that the number of them exceeded eighty-seven.
He commenced the transcription of the great commentary
of Nicholas de Lyra upon the whole Bible,
which had then been published some few years.
"Det Deus, ut in nostris felicem habere valeat<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272"></a>[<a href="./images/272.png">272</a>]</span>
consummacionem,"<a name="FNanchor_416_416" id="FNanchor_416_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_416" class="fnanchor">[416]</a> exclaims the monk, nor will
the reader be surprised at the expression, if he for
one moment contemplates the magnitude of the
undertaking.</p>

<p>But not only was Whethamstede remarkable as
a bibliomaniac&mdash;he claims considerable respect as
an author. Some of his productions were more
esteemed in his own time than now; being compilations
and commentaries more adapted as a
substitute for other books, than valuable as original
works. Under this class I am inclined to place his
Granarium, a large work in five volumes; full of
miscellaneous extracts, etc., and somewhat partaking
of the encyclopediac form; his Propinarium,
in two volumes, also treating of general matters;
his Pabularium and Palearium Poetarium, and his
Proverbiarium, or book of Proverbs; to which may
be added the many pieces relating to the affairs of
the monastery. But far different must we regard
many of his other productions, which are more important
in a literary point of view, as calling for the
exercise of a refined and cultivated mind, and no
small share of critical acumen. Among these I
must not forget to include his Chronicle,<a name="FNanchor_417_417" id="FNanchor_417_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_417" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> which
spreading over a space of twenty years, forms a
valuable historical document. The rest are poetical
narratives, embracing an account of Jack Cade's
insurrection&mdash;the battles of Ferrybridge, Wakefield,
and St. Albans.<a name="FNanchor_418_418" id="FNanchor_418_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_418" class="fnanchor">[418]</a></p>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273"></a>[<a href="./images/273.png">273</a>]</span></p><p>A Cottonian manuscript contained a catalogue

it was burnt, with many others forming
part of that inestimable collection.<a name="FNanchor_419_419" id="FNanchor_419_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_419" class="fnanchor">[419]</a> From another

the cost incurred in their transcription.<a name="FNanchor_420_420" id="FNanchor_420_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_420" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> Twenty
marks were paid for copying his Granarium, in four
volumes; forty shillings for his Palearium; the
same for a Polycraticon of John of Salisbury; five
pounds for a Boethius, with a gloss; upwards of
six pounds for "a book of Cato," enriched with a
gloss and table; and four pounds for Gorham upon
Luke. Whethamstede ordered a Grael to be
written so beautifully illuminated, and so superbly
bound, as to be valued at the enormous sum of
twenty pounds: but let it be remembered that my
Lord Abbot was a very epicure in books, and
thought a great deal of choice bindings, tall copies,
immaculate parchment, and brilliant illuminations,
and the high prices which he freely gave for these
book treasures evince how sensible he was to the
joys of bibliomania; nor am I inclined to regard
the works thus attained as "mere monastic trash."<a name="FNanchor_421_421" id="FNanchor_421_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_421" class="fnanchor">[421]</a></p>

<p>The finest illumination in the Cotton manuscript
is a portrait of Abbot Whethamstede, which for
artistic talent is far superior to any in the volume.
Eight folios are occupied with an enumeration of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274"></a>[<a href="./images/274.png">274</a>]</span>
the "good works" of this liberal monk: among the
items we find the sum of forty pounds having been
expended on a reading desk, and four pounds for
writing four Antiphoners.<a name="FNanchor_422_422" id="FNanchor_422_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_422" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> He displayed also
great liberality of spirit in his benefactions to
Gloucester College, at Oxford, besides great pecuniary
aid. He built a library there, and gave many
valuable books for the use of the students, in which
he wrote these verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">

<p>In others he wrote&mdash;</p>

</div></div>

<p>If we estimate worth by comparison, we must
award a large proportion to this learned abbot.
Living in the most corrupt age of the monastic
system, when the evils attendant on luxurious ease
began to be too obvious in the cloister, and when<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275"></a>[<a href="./images/275.png">275</a>]</span>
complaints were heard at first in a whispering
murmur, but anon in a stern loud voice of wroth
and indignant remonstrance&mdash;when in fact the
progressive, inquiring spirit of the reformation was
taking root in what had hitherto been regarded as
a hard, dry, stony soil. This coming tempest, only
heard as yet like the lulling of a whisper, was
nevertheless sufficiently loud to spread terror and
dismay among the cowled habitants of the monasteries.
That quietude and mental ease so indispensable
to study&mdash;so requisite for the growth of
thought and intellectuality, was disturbed by these
distant sounds, or dissipated by their own indolence.
And yet in the midst of all this, rendered
still more anxious and perplexing by domestic
troubles and signs of discontent and insubordination
among the monks. Whethamstede found time, and
what was better the spirit, for literary and bibliomanical
pursuits. Honor to the man, monk though
he be, who oppressed with these vicissitudes and
cares could effect so much, and could appreciate
both literature and art.</p>

<p>Contemporary with him we are not surprised
that he gained the patronage and friendship of
Humphrey Duke of Gloucester, to whom he dedicated
many of his own performances, and greatly
aided in collecting those treasures which the duke
regarded with such esteem. It is said that noble
collector frequently paid a friendly visit to the
abbey to inspect the work of the monkish scribes,
and perhaps to negociate for some of those choice
vellum tomes for which the monks of that monastery
were so renowned.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276"></a>[<a href="./images/276.png">276</a>]</span></p>

<p>But we must not pass the "good duke" without
some slight notice of his "ryghte valiant deedes,"
his domestic troubles and his dark mysterious end.
Old Foxe thus speaks of him in his Actes and
Monuments: "Of manners he seemed meeke and
gentle, louing the commonwealth, a supporter of
the poore commons, of wit and wisdom, discrete
and studious, well affected to religion and a friend
to verity, and no lesse enemy to pride and ambition,
especially in haughtie prelates, which was his
undoing in this present evil world. And, which is
seldom and rare in such princes of that calling, he
was both learned himselfe and no lesse given to
studie, and also a singular favourer and patron to
those who were studious and learned."<a name="FNanchor_424_424" id="FNanchor_424_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_424" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> To which
I cannot refrain from adding the testimony of
Hollingshed, who tells us that "The ornaments
of his mind were both rare and admirable; the
feats of chiualrie by him commensed and atchiued
valiant and fortunate; his grauitie in counsell and
soundnesse of policie profound and singular; all
which with a traine of other excellent properties
linked together, require a man of manifold gifts to
aduance them according to their dignitie. I refer
the readers unto Maister Foxe's booke of Actes
and Monuments. Onelie this I ad, that in respect
of his noble indowments and his demeanor full of
decencie, which he dailie used, it seemeth he might
wel haue giuen this prettie poesie:"</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Virtute duce non sanguine nitor."<a name="FNanchor_425_425" id="FNanchor_425_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_425" class="fnanchor">[425]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277"></a>[<a href="./images/277.png">277</a>]</span></p><p>But with all these high qualities, our notions of
propriety are somewhat shocked at the open
manner in which he kept his mistress Eleanor
Cobham; but we can scarcely agree in the condemnation
of the generality of historians for his
marrying her afterwards, but regard it rather as
the action of an honorable man, desirous of making
every reparation in his power.<a name="FNanchor_426_426" id="FNanchor_426_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_426" class="fnanchor">[426]</a> But the "pride of
birth" was sorely wounded by the espousals; and
the enmity of the aristocracy already roused, now
became deeply rooted. Eleanor's disposition is
represented as passionate and unreasonable, and
her mind sordid and oppressive. Be this how it
may, we must remember that it is from her enemies
we learn it; and if so, unrelenting persecution and
inveterate malice were proceedings ill calculated to
soothe a temper prone to violence, or to elevate a
mind undoubtedly weak. But the vindictive and
haughty cardinal Beaufort was the open and secret
enemy of the good duke Humphrey; for not only
did he thwart every public measure proposed by
his rival, but employed spies to insinuate themselves
into his domestic circle, and to note and
inform him of every little circumstance which malice
could distort into crime, or party rage into treason.
This detestable espionage met with a too speedy
success. The duke, who was especially fond of
the society of learned men, retained in his family
many priests and clerks, and among them one
Roger Bolingbroke, "a famous necromancer and
astronomer." This was a sufficient ground for the
enmity of the cardinal to feed upon, and he deter<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278"></a>[<a href="./images/278.png">278</a>]</span>mined
to annihilate at one blow the domestic
happiness of his rival. He arrested the Duchess,
Bolingbroke, and a witch called Margery Gourdimain,
or Jourdayn, on the charge of witchcraft and
treason. He accused the priest and Margery of
making, and the duchess for having in her possession,
a waxen figure, which, as she melted it before
a slow fire, so would the body of the king waste and
decay, and his marrow wither in his bones. Her
enemies tried her, and of course found her and her
companions guilty, though without a shred of
evidence to the purpose. The duchess was sentenced
to do penance in St. Paul's and two other
churches on three separate days, and to be afterwards
imprisoned in the Isle of Man for life.
Bolingbroke, who protested his innocence to the
last, was hung and quartered at Tyburn; and
Margery, the witch of Eye, as she was called, was
burnt at Smithfield. But the black enmity of the
cardinal was sorely disappointed at the effect produced
by this persecution. He reasonably judged
that no accusation was so likely to arouse a popular
prejudice against duke Humphrey as appealing to
the superstition of the people who in that age were
ever prone to receive the most incredulous fabrications;
but far different was the impression made in
the present case. The people with more than their
usual sagacity saw through the flimsy designs of
the cardinal and his faction; and while they pitied
the victims of party malice, loved and esteemed the
good duke Humphrey more than ever.</p>

<p>But the intriguing heart of Beaufort soon resolved
upon the most desperate measures, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279"></a>[<a href="./images/279.png">279</a>]</span>
shrunk not from staining his priestly hands with
innocent and honorable blood. A parliament was
summoned to meet at St. Edmunds Bury, in Suffolk,
on the 10th of February, 1447, at which all
the nobility were ordered to assemble. On the
arrival of Duke Humphrey, the cardinal arrested
him on a groundless charge of high treason, and a
few days after he was found dead in his bed, his
enemies gave out that he had died of the palsy;
but although his body was eagerly shown to the
sorrowing multitude, the people believed that their
friend and favorite had been foully murdered, and
feared not to raise their voice in loud accusations
at the Suffolk party; "sum sayed that he was
smouldered betwixt two fetherbeddes,"<a name="FNanchor_427_427" id="FNanchor_427_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_427" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> and others
declared that he had suffered a still more barbarous
death. Deep was the murmuring and the grief of
the people, for the good duke had won the love
and esteem of their hearts; and we can fully
believe a contemporary who writes&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Compleyne al Yngland thys goode Lorde's deth."<a name="FNanchor_428_428" id="FNanchor_428_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_428" class="fnanchor">[428]</a><br /></span>
</div></div>

<p>Perhaps none suffered more by his death than the
author and the scholar; for Duke Humphrey was
a munificent patron of letters, and loved to correspond
with learned men, many of whom dedicated
their works to him, and received ample encouragement
in return.<a name="FNanchor_429_429" id="FNanchor_429_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_429" class="fnanchor">[429]</a> Lydgate, who knew him well,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280"></a>[<a href="./images/280.png">280</a>]</span>

speaks of him:</p>

<p>Duke Humphrey gave a noble instance of his great
love of learning in the year 1439, when he presented
to the University of Oxford one hundred and
twenty-nine treatises, and shortly after, one hundred
and twenty-six <i>admirandi apparatus</i>; and in the
same year, nine more. In 1443, he made another
important donation of one hundred and thirty
volumes, to which he added one hundred and
thirty-five more,<a name="FNanchor_432_432" id="FNanchor_432_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_432" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> making in all, a collection of five
hundred and thirty-eight volumes. These treasures,
too, had been collected with all the nice
acumen of a bibliomaniac, and the utmost attention
was paid to their outward condition and internal
purity. Never, perhaps, were so many costly copies<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282"></a>[<a href="./images/282.png">282</a>]</span>
seen before, dazzling with the splendor of their
illuminations, and rendered inestimable by the
many faithful miniatures with which they were
enriched. A superb copy of Valerius Maximus is
the only relic of that costly and noble gift, a solitary
but illustrious example of the membraneous treasures
of that ducal library.<a name="FNanchor_433_433" id="FNanchor_433_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_433" class="fnanchor">[433]</a> But alas! those very
indications of art, those exquisite illuminations,
were the fatal cause of their unfortunate end; the
portraits of kings and eminent men, with which the
historical works were adorned; the diagrams which
pervaded the scientific treatises, were viewed by
the zealous reformers of Henry's reign, as damning
evidence of their Popish origin and use; and released
from the chains with which they were
secured, they were hastily committed to the greedy
flames. Thus perished the library of Humphrey,
duke of Gloucester! and posterity have to mourn
the loss of many an early gem of English literature.<a name="FNanchor_434_434" id="FNanchor_434_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_434" class="fnanchor">[434]</a></p>

<p>But in the fourteenth century many other
honorable examples occur of lay collectors. The
magnificent volumes, nine hundred in number, col<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283"></a>[<a href="./images/283.png">283</a>]</span>lected
by Charles V. of France, a passionate bibliomaniac,
were afterwards brought by the duke of
Bedford into England. The library then contained
eight hundred and fifty-three volumes, so sumptuously
bound and gorgeously illuminated as to be
valued at 2,223 livres!<a name="FNanchor_435_435" id="FNanchor_435_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_435" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> This choice importation
diffused an eager spirit of inquiry among the more
wealthy laymen. Humphrey, the "good duke,"
received some of these volumes as presents, and
among others, a rich copy of Livy, in French.<a name="FNanchor_436_436" id="FNanchor_436_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_436_436" class="fnanchor">[436]</a>
Guy Beauchamp, Earl of Warwick, also collected
some choice tomes, and possessed an unusually
interesting library of early romances. He left the
whole of them to the monks of Bordesley Abbey
in Worcestershire, about the year 1359.<a name="FNanchor_437_437" id="FNanchor_437_437"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_437" class="fnanchor">[437]</a> As a
specimen of a private library in the fourteenth
century, I am tempted to extract it.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">he</span> old monastic orders of St.
Augustine and St. Benedict, of
whose love of books we have
principally spoken hitherto, were
kept from falling into sloth and
ignorance in the thirteenth century
by the appearance of several
new orders of devotees. The Dominicans,<a name="FNanchor_438_438" id="FNanchor_438_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_438_438" class="fnanchor">[438]</a> the
Franciscans,<a name="FNanchor_439_439" id="FNanchor_439_439"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_439" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> and the Carmelites were each renowned
for their profound learning, and their
unquenchable passion for knowledge; assuming a
garb of the most abject poverty, renouncing all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288"></a>[<a href="./images/288.png">288</a>]</span>
love of the world, all participation in its temporal
honors, and refraining to seek the aggrandizement
of their order by fixed oblations or state endowments,
but adhering to a voluntary system for support,
they caused a visible sensation among all
classes, and wrought a powerful change in the
ecclesiastical and collegiate learning of the fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries; and by their devotion,
their charity, their strict austerity, and by
their brilliant and unconquerable powers of disputation,
soon gained the respect and affections of
the people.<a name="FNanchor_440_440" id="FNanchor_440_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_440_440" class="fnanchor">[440]</a></p>

<p>Much as the friars have been condemned, or
darkly as they have been represented, I have no
hesitation in saying that they did more for the
revival of learning, and the progress of English
literature, than any other of the monastic orders.
We cannot trace their course without admiration
and astonishment at their splendid triumphs and
success; they appear to act as intellectual crusaders
against the prevailing ignorance and sloth. The
finest names that adorn the literary annals of the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, the most prolific
authors who flourished during that long period
were begging friars; and the very spirit that was
raised against them by the churchmen, and the
severe controversal battles which they had between
them, were the means of doing a vast amount of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289"></a>[<a href="./images/289.png">289</a>]</span>
good, of exposing ignorance in high places, and
compelling those who enjoyed the honors of
learning to strive to merit them, by a studious
application to literature and science; need I do
more than mention the shining names of Duns
Scotus, of Thomas Aquinas, of Roger Bacon, the
founder of experimental philosophy, and the justly
celebrated Robert Grostest, the most enlightened
ecclesiastic of his age.<a name="FNanchor_441_441" id="FNanchor_441_441"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_441" class="fnanchor">[441]</a></p>

<p>We may not admire the scholastic philosophy
which the followers of Francis and Dominic held
and expounded; we may deplore the intricate mazes
and difficulties which a false philosophy led them to
maintain, and we may equally deplore the waste of
time and learning which they lavished in the vain
hope of solving the mysteries of God, or in comprehending
a loose and futile science. Yet the
philosophy of the schoolmen is but little understood,
and is too often condemned without reason
or without proof; for those who trouble themselves
to denounce, seldom care to read them; their ponderous
volumes are too formidable to analyze; it is
so much easier to declaim than to examine such
sturdy antagonists; but we owe to the schoolmen
far more than we are apt to suppose, and if it were
possible to scratch their names from the page of
history, and to obliterate all traces of their bulky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290"></a>[<a href="./images/290.png">290</a>]</span>
writings from our libraries and from our literature,
we should find our knowledge dark and gloomy in
comparison with what it is.</p></div>

<p>But the mendicant orders did not study and
uphold the scholastic philosophy without improving
it; the works of Aristotle, of which it is said the
early schoolmen possessed only a vitiated translation
from the Arabic,<a name="FNanchor_442_442" id="FNanchor_442_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_442" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> was, at the period these
friars sprung up, but imperfectly understood and
taught. Michael Scot, with the assistance of a
learned Jew,<a name="FNanchor_443_443" id="FNanchor_443_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_443" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> translated and published the writings
of the great philosopher in Latin, which greatly
superseded the old versions derived from the
Saracen copies.</p>

<p>The mendicant friars having qualified themselves
with a respectable share of Greek learning,
then taught and expounded the Aristotelian
philosophy according to this new translation, and
opened a new and proscribed field<a name="FNanchor_444_444" id="FNanchor_444_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_444" class="fnanchor">[444]</a> for disputation
and enquiry; their indomitable perseverance, their
acute powers of reasoning, and the splendid popularity
which many of the disciples of St. Dominic<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291"></a>[<a href="./images/291.png">291</a>]</span>
and St. Francis were fast acquiring, caused students
to flock in crowds to their seats of learning, and all
who were inspired to an acquaintance with scholastic
philosophy placed themselves under their training
and tuition.<a name="FNanchor_445_445" id="FNanchor_445_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_445" class="fnanchor">[445]</a></p>

<p>No religious order before them ever carried the
spirit of inquiry to such an extent as they, or
allowed it to wander over such an unbounded
field. The most difficult and mysterious questions
of theology were discussed and fearlessly
analyzed; far from exercising that blind and easy
credulity which mark the religious conduct of the
old monastic orders, they were disposed to probe
and examine every article of their faith. To such
an extent were their disputations carried, that
sometimes it shook their faith in the orthodoxy of
Rome, and often aroused the pious fears of the
more timid of their own order. Angell de Pisa,
who founded the school of the Franciscans or Grey
Friars at Oxford, is said to have gone one day
into his school, with a view to discover what
progress the students were making in their studies;
as he entered he found them warm in disputation,
and was shocked to find that the question at issue
was "<i>whether there was a God</i>;" the good man,
greatly alarmed, cried out, "Alas, for me! alas, for
me! simple brothers pierce the heavens and the
learned dispute whether there be a God!" and with
great indignation ran out of the house blaming
himself for having established a school for such
fearful disputes; but he afterwards returned and
remained among his pupils, and purchased for ten<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292"></a>[<a href="./images/292.png">292</a>]</span>
marks a corrected copy of the decretals, to which
he made his students apply their minds.<a name="FNanchor_446_446" id="FNanchor_446_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_446" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> This
school was the most flourishing of those belonging
to the Franciscans; and it was here that the
celebrated Robert Grostest<a name="FNanchor_447_447" id="FNanchor_447_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_447" class="fnanchor">[447]</a>, bishop of Lincoln,
read lectures about the year 1230. He was a
profound scholar, thoroughly conversant with the
most abstruse matters of philosophy, and a great
Bible reader.<a name="FNanchor_448_448" id="FNanchor_448_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_448" class="fnanchor">[448]</a> He possessed an extensive knowledge
of the Greek, and translated, into Latin,
Dionysius the Areopagite, Damascenus, Suida's
Greek Lexicon, a Greek Grammar, and, with the
assistance of Nicholas, a monk of St. Alban's, the
History of the Twelve Patriarchs. He collected
a fine library of Greek books, many of which he
obtained from Athens. Roger Bacon speaks of
his knowledge of the Greek, and says, that he
caused a vast number of books to be gathered
together in that tongue.<a name="FNanchor_449_449" id="FNanchor_449_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_449" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> His extraordinary talent
and varied knowledge caused him to be deemed
a conjuror and astrologer by the ignorant and
superstitious; and his enemies, who were numerous
and powerful, did not refuse to encourage the slanderous
report. We find him so represented by
the poet Gower:&mdash;</p>

<p>The Franciscan convent at Oxford contained
two libraries, one for the use of the graduates and
one for the secular students, who did not belong to
their order, but who were receiving instruction
from them. Grostest gave many volumes to these
libraries, and at his death he bequeathed to the
convent all his books, which formed no doubt a
fine collection. "To these were added," says
Wood, "the works of Roger Bacon, who, Bale tells
us, writ an hundred Treatises. There were also
volumes of other writers of the same order, which,
I believe, amounted to no small number. In short,
I guess that these libraries were filled with all sorts
of erudition, because the friars of all orders, and
chiefly the Franciscans, used so diligently to procure
all monuments of literature from all parts, that
wise men looked upon it as an injury to laymen,
who, therefore, found a difficulty to get any books.
Several books of Grostest and Bacon treated of
astronomy and mathematics, besides some relating<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294"></a>[<a href="./images/294.png">294</a>]</span>
to the Greek tongue. But these friars, as I have
found by certain ancient manuscripts, bought many
Hebrew books of the Jews who were disturbed in
England. In a word, they, to their utmost power,
purchased whatsoever was anywhere to be had of
singular learning."<a name="FNanchor_451_451" id="FNanchor_451_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_451" class="fnanchor">[451]</a></p>

<p>Many of the smaller convents of the Franciscan
order possessed considerable libraries, which they
purchased or received as gifts from their patrons.<a name="FNanchor_452_452" id="FNanchor_452_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_452" class="fnanchor">[452]</a>
There was a house of Grey Friars at Exeter,<a name="FNanchor_453_453" id="FNanchor_453_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_453" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> and
Roger de Thoris, Archdeacon of Exeter, gave or
lent them a library of books in the year 1266, soon
after their establishment, reserving to himself the
privilege of using them, and forbade the friars from
selling or parting with them. The collection, however,
contained less than twenty volumes, and was
formed principally of the scriptures and writings of
their own order. "Whosoever," concludes the
document, "shall presume hereafter to separate or
destroy this donation of mine, may he incur the
malediction of the omnipotent God! dated on the
day of the purification, in the year of our Lord
<span class="smcap">mcclxvi</span>."<a name="FNanchor_454_454" id="FNanchor_454_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_454" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>The library of the Grey Friars in London was
of more than usual magnificence and extent. It was
founded by the celebrated Richard Whittington.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295"></a>[<a href="./images/295.png">295</a>]</span>
Its origin is thus set forth in an old manuscript in
the Cottonian library:<a name="FNanchor_455_455" id="FNanchor_455_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_455" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>"In the year of our Lord, 1421, the worshipful
Richard Whyttyngton, knight and mayor of London,
began the new library and laid the first foundation-stone
on the 21st day of October; that is,
on the feast of St. Hilarion the abbot. And the
following year before the feast of the nativity of
Christ, the house was raised and covered; and
in three years after, it was floored, whitewashed,
glazed,<a name="FNanchor_456_456" id="FNanchor_456_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_456" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> adorned with shelves, statues, and carving,
and furnished with books: and the expenses about
what is aforesaid amount to &pound;556:16:9; of which
sum, the aforesaid Richard Whyttyngton paid
&pound;400, and the residue was paid by the reverend
father B. Thomas Winchelsey and his friends, to
whose soul God be propitious.&mdash;Amen."</p>

<p>Among some items of money expended, we
find, "for the works of Doctor de Lyra contained
in two volumes, now in the chains,<a name="FNanchor_457_457" id="FNanchor_457_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_457" class="fnanchor">[457]</a> 100 marks, of
which B. John Frensile remitted 20s.; and for the
Lectures of Hostiensis, now lying in the chains,
5 marks."<a name="FNanchor_458_458" id="FNanchor_458_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_458" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> Leland speaks in the most enthusiastic
terms of this library, and says, that it far surpassed
all others for the number and antiquity of its volumes.
John Wallden bequeathed as many manu<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296"></a>[<a href="./images/296.png">296</a>]</span>scripts
of celebrated authors as were worth two
thousand pounds.<a name="FNanchor_459_459" id="FNanchor_459_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_459" class="fnanchor">[459]</a></p>

<p>The library of the Dominicans in London was
also at one time well stored with valuable books.
Leland mentions some of those he found there, and
among them some writings of Wicliff;<a name="FNanchor_460_460" id="FNanchor_460_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_460" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> indeed
those of this order were renowned far and wide for
their love of study; look at the old portraits of a
Dominican friar, and you will generally see him
with the pen in one hand and a book in the other;
but they were more ambitious in literature than
the monks, and aimed at the honors of an author
rather than at those of a scribe; but we are surprised
more at their fertility than at their style or
originality in the mysteries of bookcraft. Henry
Esseburn diligently read at Oxford, and devoted his
whole soul to study, and wrote a number of works,
principally on the Bible; he was appointed to
govern the Dominican monastery at Chester;
"being remote from all schools, he made use of
his spare hours to revise and polish what he had
writ at Oxford; having performed the same to his
own satisfaction, he caused his works to be fairly
transcribed, and copies of them to be preserved in
several libraries of his order.<ins title="Transcriber's Note: added missing quotation mark">"</ins><a name="FNanchor_461_461" id="FNanchor_461_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_461" class="fnanchor">[461]</a> But they did not
usually pay so much attention to the duties of
transcribing. The Dominicans were fond of the
physical sciences, and have been accused of too
much partiality for occult philosophy. Leland tells<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297"></a>[<a href="./images/297.png">297</a>]</span>
us that Robert Perserutatur, a Dominican, was over
solicitous in prying into the secrets of philosophy,<a name="FNanchor_462_462" id="FNanchor_462_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_462" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
and lays the same charge to many others.</p>

<p>The Carmelites were more careful in transcribing
books than the Dominicans, and anxiously
preserved them from dust and worms; but I can
find but little notice of their libraries; the one at
Oxford was a large room, where they arranged
their books in cases made for that purpose; before
the foundation of this library, the Carmelites kept
their books in chests, and doubtless gloried in an
ample store of manuscript treasures.<a name="FNanchor_463_463" id="FNanchor_463_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_463" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<p>But in the fifteenth century we find the Mendicant
Friars, like the order religious sects, disregarding
those strict principles of piety which had
for two hundred years so distinguished their order.
The holy rules of St. Francis and St. Dominic
were seldom read with much attention, and never
practised with severity; they became careless in
the propagation of religious principles, relaxed in
their austerity, and looked with too much fondness
on the riches and honors of the world.<a name="FNanchor_464_464" id="FNanchor_464_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_464" class="fnanchor">[464]</a> This
diminution in religious zeal was naturally accompanied
by a proportionate decrease in learning and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298"></a>[<a href="./images/298.png">298</a>]</span>
love of study. The sparkling orator, the acute
controversialist, or the profound scholar, might
have been searched for in vain among the Franciscans
or the Dominicans of the fifteenth century.
Careless in literary matters, they thought little of
collecting books, or preserving even those which
their libraries already contained; the Franciscans
at Oxford "sold many of their books to Dr. Thomas
Gascoigne, about the year 1433,<a name="FNanchor_465_465" id="FNanchor_465_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_465_465" class="fnanchor">[465]</a> which he gave to
the libraries of Lincoln, Durham, Baliol, and Oriel.
They also declining in strictness of life and learning,
sold many more to other persons, so that their
libraries declined to little or nothing."<a name="FNanchor_466_466" id="FNanchor_466_466"></a><a href="#Footnote_466_466" class="fnanchor">[466]</a></p>

<p>We are not therefore surprised at the disappointment
of Leland, on examining this famous
repository; his expectations were raised by the
care with which he found the library guarded, and
the difficulty he had to obtain access to it: but when
he entered, he did not find one-third the number of
books which it originally contained; but dust and
cobwebs, moths and beetles he found in abundance,
which swarmed over the empty shelves.<a name="FNanchor_467_467" id="FNanchor_467_467"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_467" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

<p>The mendicant friars have rendered themselves
famous by introducing theatrical representations<a name="FNanchor_468_468" id="FNanchor_468_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_468" class="fnanchor">[468]</a>
for the amusement and instruction of the people.
These shows were usually denominated miracles,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299"></a>[<a href="./images/299.png">299</a>]</span>
moralities, or mysteries, and were performed by
the friars in their convents or on portable stages,
which were wheeled into the market places and
streets for the convenience of the spectators.</p>

<p>The friars of the monastery of the Franciscans
at Coventry are particularly celebrated for their ingenuity
in performing these pageants on Corpus
Christi day; a copy of this play or miracle is preserved
in the Cottonian Collection, written in old
English rhyme. It embraces the transactions of
the Old and New Testament, and is entitled <i>Ludus
Corpus Christi</i>. It commences&mdash;</p>

<p>These miracles were intended to instruct the
more ignorant, or those whose circumstances placed
the usual means of acquiring knowledge beyond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300"></a>[<a href="./images/300.png">300</a>]</span>
their reach; but as books became accessible, they
were no longer needed; the printing press made
the Bible, from which the plots of the miracle plays
were usually derived, common among the people,
and these gaudy representations were swept away
by the Reformation; but they were temporarily
revived in Queen Mary's time, with the other
abominations of the church papal, for we find that
"in the year 1556 a goodly stage play of the
Passion of Christ was presented at the Grey Friers
in London on Corpus Christi day," before the Lord
Mayor and citizens;<a name="FNanchor_470_470" id="FNanchor_470_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_470" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> but we have nothing here to
do with anecdotes illustrating a period so late as
this.</p>

<p>We have now arrived at the dawn of a new era
in learning, and the slow, plodding, laborious
scribes of the monasteries were startled by the appearance
of an invention with which their poor
pens had no power to compete. The year 1472
was the last of the parchment literature of the
monks, and the first in the English annals of
printed learning; but we must not forget that the
monks with all their sloth and ignorance, were the
foremost among the encouragers of the early printing
press in England; the monotony of the dull
cloisters of Westminster Abbey was broken by the
clanking of Caxton's press; and the prayers of the
monks of old St. Albans mingled with the echoes
of the pressman's labor. Little did those barefooted
priests know what an opponent to their
Romish rites they were fostering into life; their<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301"></a>[<a href="./images/301.png">301</a>]</span>
love of learning and passion for books, drove all
fear away; and the splendor of the new power so
dazzled their eyes that they could not clearly see
the nature of the refulgent light just bursting
through the gloom of ages.</p>

<p>After the invention of the printing art, bibliomania
took some mighty strides; and many choice
collectors, full of ardor in the pursuit, became renowned
for the vast book stores they amassed together.
But some of their names have been preserved
and good deeds chronicled by Dibdin, of
bibliographical renown; so that a chapter is not
necessary here to extol them. We may judge how
fashionable the avocation became by the keen satire
of Alexander Barkley, in his translation of Brandt's
<i>Navis Stultifera</i> or Shyp of Folys,<a name="FNanchor_471_471" id="FNanchor_471_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_471" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> who gives a
curious illustration of a bibliomaniac; and thus
speaks of those collectors who amassed their book
treasures without possessing much esteem for their
contents.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">e</span> have traversed through the darkness
of many long and dreary
centuries, and with the aid of a
few old manuscripts written by the
monks in the <i>scriptoria</i> of their
monasteries, caught an occasional
glimpse of their literary labors and
love of books; these parchment volumes being mere
monastic registers, or terse historic compilations,
do not record with particular care the anecdotes
applicable to my subject, but appear to be mentioned
almost accidentally, and certainly without
any ostentatious design; but such as they are we
learn from them at least one thing, which some of
us might not have known before&mdash;that the monks
of old, besides telling their beads, singing psalms,
and muttering their breviary, had yet one other
duty to perform&mdash;the transcription of books. And
I think there is sufficient evidence that they fulfilled
this obligation with as much zeal as those of a
more strictly monastic or religious nature. It is<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306"></a>[<a href="./images/306.png">306</a>]</span>
true, in casting our eye over the history of their
labors, many regrets will arise that they did not
manifest a little more taste and refinement in their
choice of books for transcribing. The classical
scholar will wish the holy monks had thought more
about his darling authors of Greece and Rome;
but the pious puritan historian blames them for
patronizing the romantic allurements of Ovid, or
the loose satires of Juvenal, and throws out some
slanderous hint that they must have found a sympathy
in those pages of licentiousness, or why so
anxious to preserve them? The protestant is still
more scandalized, and denounces the monks, their
books, scriptorium and all together as part and parcel
of popish craft and Romish superstition. But surely
the crimes of popedom and the evils of monachism,
that thing of dry bones and fabricated relics, are
bad enough; and the protestant cause is sufficiently
holy, that we may afford to be honest if we cannot
to be generous. What good purpose then will it
serve to cavil at the monks forever? All readers
of history know how corrupt they became in the
fifteenth century; how many evils were wrought
by the craft of some of them, and how pernicious
the system ultimately waxed. We can all, I say,
reflect upon these things, and guard against them in
future; but it is not just to apply the same indiscriminate
censure to all ages. Many of the purest
Christians of the church, the brightest ornaments
of Christ's simple flock, were barefooted cowled
monks of the cloister; devout perhaps to a fault,
with simplicity verging on superstition; yet nevertheless
faithful, pious men, and holy. Look at all<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307"></a>[<a href="./images/307.png">307</a>]</span>
this with an eye of charity; avoid their errors and
manifold faults: but to forget the loathsome thing
our minds have conjured up as the type of an
ancient monk. Remember they had a few books
to read, and venerated something more than the
dry bones of long withered saints. Their God
was our God, and their Saviour, let us trust, will be
our Saviour.</p></div>

<p>I am well aware that many other names might
have been added to those mentioned in the foregoing
pages, equally deserving remembrance, and
offering pleasing anecdotes of a student's life, or
illustrating the early history of English learning;
many facts and much miscellaneous matter I have
collected in reference to them; but I am fearful
whether my readers will regard this subject with
sufficient relish to enjoy more illustrations of the
same kind. Students are apt to get too fond of
their particular pursuit, which magnifies in importance
with the difficulties of their research, or the
duration of their studies. I am uncertain whether
this may not be my own position, and wait the
decision of my readers before proceeding further
in the annals of early bibliomania.</p>

<p>Moreover as to the simple question&mdash;Were the
monks booklovers? enough I think as been said to
prove it, but the enquiry is far from exhausted;
and if the reader should deem the matter still
equivocal and undecided, he must refer the blame
to the feebleness of my pen, rather than to the
barrenness of my subject. But let him not fail to
mark well the instances I have given; let him look
at Benedict Biscop and his foreign travels after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308"></a>[<a href="./images/308.png">308</a>]</span>
books; at Theodore and the early Saxons of the
seventh century; at Boniface, Alcuin, &AElig;lfric, and
the numerous votaries of bibliomania who flourished
then. Look at the well stored libraries of St. Albans,
Canterbury, Ramsey, Durham, Croyland,
Peterborough, Glastonbury, and their thousand
tomes of parchment literature. Look at Richard
de Bury and his sweet little work on biographical
experience; at Whethamstede and his industrious
pen; read the rules of monastic orders; the book
of Cassian; the regulations of St. Augustine;
Benedict Fulgentius; and the ancient admonitions
of many other holy and ascetic men. Search over
the remnants and shreds of information which have
escaped the ravages of time, and the havoc of cruel
invasions relative to these things. Attend to the
import of these small still whisperings of a forgotten
age; and then, letting the eye traverse down
the stream of time, mark the great advent of the
Reformation; that wide gulf of monkish erudition
in which was swallowed "whole shyppes full" of
olden literature; think well and deeply over the
huge bonfires of Henry's reign, the flames of which
were kindled by the libraries which monkish industry
had transcribed. A merry sound no doubt,
was the crackling of those "popish books" for
protestant ears to feed upon!</p>

<p>Now all these facts thought of collectively&mdash;brought
to bear one upon another&mdash;seem to favor
the opinion my own study has deduced from them;
that with all their superstition, with all their ignorance,
their blindness to philosophic light&mdash;the
monks of old were hearty lovers of books; that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309"></a>[<a href="./images/309.png">309</a>]</span>
they encouraged learning, fostered and transcribed
repeatedly the books which they had rescued from
the destruction of war and time; and so kindly
cherished and husbanded them as intellectual food
for posterity. Such being the case, let our hearts
look charitably upon them; and whilst we pity
them for their superstition, or blame them for their
"pious frauds," love them as brother men and
workers in the mines of literature; such a course
is far more honorable to the tenor of a christian's
heart, than bespattering their memory with foul
denunciations.</p>

<p>Some may accuse me of having shown too much
fondness&mdash;of having dwelt with a too loving tenderness
in my retrospection of the middle ages. But
in the course of my studies I have found much to
admire. In parchment annals coeval with the times
of which they speak, my eyes have traversed over
many consecutive pages with increasing interest
and with enraptured pleasure. I have read of old
deeds worthy of an honored remembrance, where
I least expected to find them. I have met with
instances of faith as strong as death bringing forth
fruit in abundance in those sterile times, and
glorying God with its lasting incense. I have met
with instances of piety exalted to the heavens&mdash;glowing
like burning lava, and warming the cold
dull cloisters of the monks. I have read of many
a student who spent the long night in exploring
mysteries of the Bible truths; and have seen him
sketched by a monkish pencil with his ponderous
volumes spread around him, and the oil burning
brightly by his side. I have watched him in his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310"></a>[<a href="./images/310.png">310</a>]</span>
little cell thus depicted on the ancient parchment,
and have sympathized with his painful difficulties
in acquiring true knowledge, or enlightened wisdom,
within the convent walls; and then I have
read the pages of his fellow monk&mdash;perhaps, his
book-companion; and heard what <i>he</i> had to say of
that poor lonely Bible student, and have learnt
with sadness how often truth had been extinguished
from his mind by superstition, or learning cramped
by his monkish prejudices; but it has not always
been so, and I have enjoyed a more gladdening
view on finding in the monk a Bible teacher; and
in another, a profound historian, or pleasing annalist.</p>

<p>As a Christian, the recollection of these cheering
facts, with which my researches have been blessed,
are pleasurable, and lead me to look back upon
those old times with a student's fondness. But
besides piety and virtue, I have met with wisdom
and philanthropy; the former, too profound, and
the latter, too generous for the age; but these
things are precious, and worth remembering; and
how can I speak of them but in words of kindness?
It is these traits of worth and goodness that have
gained my sympathies, and twined round my heart,
and not the dark stains on the monkish page of
history; these I have always striven to forget, or to
remember them only when I thought experience
might profit by them; for they offer a terrible
lesson of blood, tyranny and anguish. But this
dark and gloomy side is the one which from our
infancy has ever been before us; we learnt it when
a child from our tutor; or at college, or at school;
we learnt it in the pages of our best and purest<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311"></a>[<a href="./images/311.png">311</a>]</span>
writers; learnt that in those old days nought
existed, but bloodshed, tyranny, and anguish; but
we never thought once to gaze at the scene behind,
and behold the workings of human charity and
love; if we had, we should have found that the
same passions, the same affections, and the same
hopes and fears existed then as now, and our sympathies
would have been won by learning that we
were reading of brother men, fellow Christians,
and fellow-companions in the Church of Christ.
We have hitherto looked, when casting a backward
glance at those long gone ages of inanimation,
with the severity of a judge upon a criminal; but
to understand him properly we must regard them
with the tender compassion of a parent; for if our
art, our science, and our philosophy exalts us far
above them, is that a proof that there was nothing
admirable, nothing that can call forth our love on
that infant state, or in the annals of our civilization
at its early growth?</p>

<p>But let it not be thought that if I have striven
to retrieve from the dust and gloom of antiquity,
the remembrance of old things that are worthy;
that I feel any love for the superstition with which
we find them blended. There is much that is good
connected with those times; talent even that is
worth imitating, and art that we may be proud to
learn, which is beginning after the elapse of centuries
to arrest the attention of the ingenious, and
the love of these, naturally revive with the discovery;
but we need not fear in this resurrection
of old things of other days, that the superstition
and weakness of the middle ages; that the venera<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312"></a>[<a href="./images/312.png">312</a>]</span>tion
for dry bones and saintly dust, can live again.
I do not wish to make the past assume a superiority
over the present; but I think a contemplation of
<ins title="Transcriber's Note: Original reads 'medi&aelig;vel'">medi&aelig;val</ins> art would often open a new avenue of
thought and lead to many a pleasing and profitable
discovery; I would too add the efforts of my feeble
pen to elevate and ennoble the fond pursuit of my
leisure hours. I would say one word to vindicate
the lover of old musty writings, and the explorer of
rude antiquities, from the charge of unprofitableness,
and to protect him from the sneer of ridicule.
For whilst some see in the dry studies of the
antiquary a mere inquisitiveness after forgotten
facts and worthless relics; I can see, nay, have felt,
something morally elevating in the exercise of these
inquiries. It is not the mere fact which may sometimes
be gained by rubbing off the parochial whitewash
from ancient tablets, or the encrusted oxide
from monumental brasses, that render the study of
ancient relics so attractive; but it is the deductions
which may sometimes be drawn from them. The
light which they sometimes cast on obscure parts of
history, and the fine touches of human sensibility,
which their eulogies and monodies bespeak, that
instruct or elevate the mind, and make the student's
heart beat with holier and loftier feelings. But it
is not my duty here to enter into the motives, the
benefits, or the most profitable manner of studying
antiquity; if it were, I would strive to show how
much superior it is to become an original investigator,
a practical antiquary, than a mere borrower
from others. For the most delightful moments of
the student's course is when he rambles person<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313"></a>[<a href="./images/313.png">313</a>]</span>ally
among the ruins and remnants of long gone
ages; sometimes painful are such sights, even
deeply so; but never to a righteous mind are they
unprofitable, much less exerting a narrowing tendency
on the mind, or cramping the gushing of
human feeling; for cold, indeed, must be the heart
that can behold strong walls tottering to decay,
and fretted vaults, mutilated and dismantled of
their pristine beauty; that can behold the proud
strongholds of baronial power and feudal tyranny,
the victims of the lichen or creeping parasites of
the ivy tribe; cold, I say, must be the heart that
can see such things, and draw no lesson from
them.</p>
